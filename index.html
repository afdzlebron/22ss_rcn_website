    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>You are </span><a
        name="epubbookmark31"></a><span>missing 50 percent of your life. And you’re not alone: everyone
        is.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Take a minute to picture it—your life, I mean.
        Scroll through the individual events, interactions, and instances that come together over the course of
        a day, a week, a month, a year, a </span><span class="calibre4">lifetime.</span><span> Think of it like
        a quilt, each square a small block of time: Here, pouring yourself a cup of coffee. Over there, reading
        a book to your child. Celebrating a success at work. Taking a walk in your neighborhood, climbing a
        mountain, diving with sharks. The mundane and the extraordinary woven together and working together,
        forming the story of your life.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Now, take half those quilt squares and rip
        them out. The irregular patchwork that’s left—a cold, drafty blanket full of holes—is the part of your
        life for which you’re mentally present. The rest is gone. You didn’t truly experience it. And chances
        are, you won’t remember it.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Why? Because you weren’t paying
        attention.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Do I have your attention right now? I hope
        so—the idea that we’re missing so much of our own lives is pretty alarming. But now that I have it, I
        won’t be able to keep it for very long. As you read this chapter, it’s likely that you’ll miss up to
        half of what I say. And on top of that, you’ll finish reading these pages convinced that you didn’t miss
        a thing.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I say this confidently, even without knowing
        who you are, or how your brain might be different from the last one we tested in my lab at the
        University of Miami, where I research the science of attention and teach cognitive neuroscience courses.
        That’s because over the course of my career as a brain scientist, I’ve seen certain universal patterns
        in the way </span><span class="calibre4">all</span><span> of our brains function—both how powerfully
        they can focus, and how extraordinarily vulnerable they are to distraction—no matter who you are or what
        you do. I’ve had the opportunity to peek inside the living human brain using the most advanced brain
        imaging technologies available, and I know that at any given moment, there’s a high probability that
        your mind just isn’t </span><span class="calibre5">here.</span><span> Instead, you’re planning for the
        next item on your to-do list. You’re ruminating on something that’s been bothering you, a worry or a
        regret. You’re thinking about something that could happen tomorrow, or the next day, or never. Any way
        you slice it, you’re not </span><span class="calibre4">here,</span><span> experiencing your life. You’re
        somewhere else.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Is this just part of being alive? A side
        effect of the human condition, something we all just have to live with? Is it really that big of a
        deal?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>After twenty-five years of studying the
        science of attention, I can answer these questions. Yes, it </span><span class="calibre4">is</span><span> part
        of being alive—in many ways, because our brain’s evolution was
        driven by specific survival pressures, </span><a name="epubbookmark32"></a><span>our attention waxes and
        wanes, making us prone to being distractible. Our distractibility served us well when predators lurked
        around every corner. However, in today’s technologically saturated, fast-paced, and rapidly shifting
        world, we’re feeling that distractibility more than ever, and we face new predators that rely on and
        exploit our distractibility. But no, it’s not something we have to just live with—we can train our
        brains to pay attention </span><span class="calibre4">differently</span><span>. And finally, and most
        importantly: yes, it </span><span class="calibre4">is</span><span> that big of a deal.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>The Extraordinary Impact of Attention</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Tell me if this ever describes you: At times,
        it feels like a struggle to stay focused. Your mind toggles between boredom and overwhelm. You feel
        foggy—as if the crisp thinking you need to rely on is simply not there. You have a short fuse. You’re
        irritable. Stressed. You notice mistakes you’ve made: typos, skipped words, or or repeated ones. (Did
        you catch that?) Deadlines loom but you find it difficult to pull yourself away from your news and
        social media feeds. You cruise through your phone, opening app after app—then you look up, some amount
        of time later, wondering what you were even looking for in the first place. You’re spending a lot of
        time in your head, out of sync with the flow of all that is happening around you. You find yourself
        spinning on interactions—something you wish you had said, something you </span><span
        class="calibre4">shouldn’t</span><span> have said, something you should have done better.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>You may be surprised to know that </span><span

    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>On a certain level, we all sense this
        already—consider the language we use when we talk about attention. </span><span class="calibre4">Pay
        attention,</span><span> we say. We ask, </span><span class="calibre4">May I have your
        attention?</span><span> We see and hear information that is </span><span
        class="calibre4">attention-grabbing</span><span>. These common phrases illuminate what we already know
        instinctively: that, like currency, attention can be paid, given, or stolen; that it is extremely
        valuable, and also finite.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Recently, the </span><a
        name="epubbookmark33"></a><span>commercial value of attention has taken center stage. As the saying goes
        for social media apps, “If you aren’t paying for the product, you </span><span class="calibre4">are</span><span>
        the product.” More precisely, your attention is the product—a
        commodity that can be sold to the highest bidder. We now have attention merchants and attention markets.
        All this forecasts a brave new dystopia involving trading in human “attention futures” alongside cattle,
        oil, and silver. Yet attention is not something that can be banked or borrowed. It cannot be saved to
        use later. We can only use our attention in the here and now—in </span><span class="calibre4">this</span><span>
        moment.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>What Is Attention, Exactly?</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The </span><span class="calibre4">attention
        system</span><span> exists to solve one of your brain’s biggest problems: there is far too much
        information in the environment for your brain to fully process. To avoid getting overloaded, your brain
        uses </span><span class="calibre4">attention</span><span> to filter out both the unnecessary noise and
        chatter around you, and the background thoughts and distractions that constantly bubble up to the
        surface of your mind.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>All day, every day, your attention system is
        in action: In a crowded coffee shop, you zero in on your computer screen and your work, while the
        conversation at the table next to you or the hissing of the espresso machine seem muffled. At the
        playground, you scan all the kids in their colorful clothing on the slides and swings but can quickly
        pick out your own. During a conversation with your co-worker, you hold a point you want to make in your
        mind, even while listening and absorbing what she’s saying. As you cross a busy street, you notice a car
        moving too fast toward you, even as a hundred other distractions exist—people flowing down the sidewalk,
        a blinking crosswalk sign, horns honking.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Without attention, you would be completely at
        sea in the world. You’d either be blank, unaware and unresponsive to events happening around you, or
        you’d be overwhelmed and paralyzed by the sheer, incoherent mass of information assaulting you. Add to
        that the relentless flow of thoughts generated by your own mind, and it would all be
        incapacitating.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>To study </span><span
        class="calibre4">how</span><span> the human brain pays attention, my research team uses a range of
        techniques—functional MRI, electrophysiological recordings, behavioral tasks, and more. We bring people
        into the lab and follow them out into their world—what we call going “in the field.” We’ve conducted
        dozens of large-scale studies and published numerous peer-reviewed articles in professional journals
        about our findings. We’ve learned three major things:</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>First, </span><span class="calibre5">attention
        is </span><span class="calibre4" style="font-weight:bold">powerful</span><span class="calibre5">.</span><span> I
        refer to it as the “brain’s boss,” because attention guides how
        information processing happens in the brain. </span><a name="epubbookmark34"></a><span>Whatever we pay
        attention to is </span><span class="calibre4">amplified</span><span>. It feels brighter, louder, crisper
        than everything else. What you focus on becomes most prominent in your present-moment reality: you feel
        the corresponding emotions; you view the world through that lens.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Second, </span><span class="calibre5">attention is
      </span><span class="calibre4" style="font-weight:bold">fragile.</span><span> It can be rapidly depleted under
        certain
        circumstances—circumstances that turn out, unfortunately, to be the ones that pervade our lives.
      </span><a name="epubbookmark35"></a><span>When we experience stress, threat, or poor mood—the three main
        things I call “kryptonite” for attention—this valuable resource is drained.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>And third, </span><span class="calibre5">attention
        is </span><span class="calibre4" style="font-weight:bold">trainable.</span><span> It is possible to change the
        way our attention systems
        operate. This is a critical new discovery, not only because we </span><span class="calibre4">are</span><span>
        missing half our lives, but because the half we’re here for can feel
        like a constant struggle. With training, however, we can strengthen our capacity to fully experience and
        enjoy the moments we are in, to embark on new adventures, and to navigate life’s challenges more
        effectively.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>We’re in a Crisis of
        Attention</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.
        but It’s Not What You Think</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We’re in a crisis of attention. We are
        exhausted and depleted, cognitively fuzzy, less effective, and less fulfilled in our lives. This crisis
        is partly systemic, driven by the </span><span class="calibre4">attention economy</span><span>, where
        inviting and highly addictive content-delivery vehicles that take the form of news, entertainment, and
        social media apps keep us scrolling and scrolling. Driven by predatory practices and a lack of
        regulation, our attention is lured and mined. And then, like mortgages and other financial products, our
        individual attention is pooled, repackaged, and sold for big profit.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>If attention evolved because there was too
        much information for us to process, then right now there’s </span><span class="calibre4">really</span><span> too
        much. The content stream is too loud, too fast, too intense,
        too interesting, too unrelenting. And we are not only recipients of this information explosion, but also
        willing participants in it. We’re going full throttle to keep up and not miss out, because we or others
        expect that of us.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>This doesn’t feel good. So why is it so hard
        to fix? We’re told to “unplug.” To “break up” with our phones. To work in shorter, more focused bursts.
        But our brains don’t stand a fighting chance. We can’t outsmart the algorithms designed by an army of
        software engineers and psychologists. The power of this artificial intelligence lies in its
        adaptability—constantly learning from us how to best grab our attention, and keep us locked in. It uses
        the same type of reinforcement that keeps people sitting in front of slot machines in smoky casinos for
        hours on end, with a dazed look on their faces and a bucket of coins in their laps. But it’s not a slot
        machine in front of us, it’s an app. And it’s not coins we’re feeding, </span><span class="calibre4">it’s our
        attention.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I want to make one thing crystal clear:
      </span><span class="calibre4">there is nothing wrong with your attention.</span><span> In fact, it’s working
        so well, and so on cue, that computer programs can predict how it will respond. We’re in a crisis
      </span><span class="calibre4">because</span><span> our attention works so well. It’s doing exactly what it
        was designed to do: respond powerfully to certain stimuli. You can’t defeat algorithms on social media
        websites, the Pavlovian pull of your phone’s dings and bings, the blaring red notification bubble of
        your inbox, or the desire to complete one more quest so you can up-level. Yet, we aren’t helpless. We
        can solve this attention crisis.</span></p>

        to get better at fighting the pull on your attention. </span><span class="calibre4">You cannot win that
        fight.</span><span> Instead, cultivate the capacity and skill to position your mind so you don’t
      </span><span class="calibre4">have</span><span> to fight.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>That’s the problem with existing
        solutions—they are instructing us to go to war against the forces that pull on our attention. Like
        swimming against a riptide, it’s exhausting and ineffective. Instead, we need to move away from that
        mode of struggling with our attention. Like a skilled swimmer who recognizes the ocean’s pull and swims
        sideways to safety, we need to be able to spot the cues.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>Pay Attention to Your Attention</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Think about the things that suddenly clue you
        in that your attention is off-track. You might get to the bottom of a page you’re reading and realize
        you’ve absorbed none of it—it’s the physical turning of the page (or scrolling to the next screen) that
        cues you. You’re deep in thought when you hear the sound of your name and an irritated “Hello? Are you
        listening?” and you realize that you departed from the conversation quite a while ago—it’s the person’s
        voice that cues you. You block websites or limit your access by loading an app that times you out; it’s
        the “Time’s up!” notification that cues you. But by the time these external cues catch you, over and
        over again all day, you’ve already spent far too much time in a brain state that has depleted and
        degraded your attention, leaving you with declining cognitive resources and increasingly less capable of
        catching yourself—it’s an exponential downward spiral.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We think of this as an exclusively
        contemporary problem—a crisis born out of our high-tech era. Yes, it’s true that we are living in a
        period of unprecedented targeting of our attention. But we don’t need external stimuli to have a crisis
        of attention—this has </span><span class="calibre4">always</span><span> been a challenge for humans.
      </span><a name="epubbookmark37"></a><span>We have records of medieval monks in the year 420 fretting that
        they could not keep their thoughts on God as they were supposed to—they complained they were constantly
        thinking about lunch, or sex. They felt overwhelmed with information, frustrated that the minute they
        sat down to read something, their restless minds wanted to read something else instead. </span><span
        class="calibre4">Why could they not just focus? Why did the mind disobey?</span><span> They went so far
        as to cut off relationships with family and give up all their possessions—the idea being that if they
        had fewer earthly entanglements to think about, they’d be less distracted. Did it work? No.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Over a thousand years later, in 1890, the
        psychologist and philosopher William James expressed the attention struggle, and the persistent lack of
        a solution:</span></p>
    <p class="extract" style="margin:12pt 14pt"><a name="epubbookmark38"></a><span>The faculty of voluntarily
        bringing back a wandering attention, over and over again, is the very root of judgment, character, and
        will. No one is [master of himself] if he have it not. An education which should improve this faculty
        would be </span><span class="calibre4">the</span><span> education par excellence. But it is easier to
        define this ideal than to give practical directions for bringing it about.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Even if we could—with the swish of a magic
        wand—wipe away all our technology, our glowing late-night laptops and buzzing phones, it wouldn’t work.
      </span><a name="epubbookmark39"></a><span>The mind’s nature is to forage for information and engage with
        it—whether it’s the phone in your pocket or the bubbling thoughts in your mind. You don’t need to be
        immersed in this digital ocean we all live in today to feel the pain of restless, depleted attention,
        and to suffer from it. We can look back a thousand years and see that our fellow humans were
        experiencing the same.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Our problem is not the phone, nor is it our
        rapidly filling inbox. It’s not that we are surrounded by attention-grabbing news and information at all
        times. It’s not the team of software engineers working on new and better ways to trap your attention
        with that buzzing and beeping rectangle tethered to you day and night. The problem is that we often
        don’t know what’s happening in our own minds. We lack </span><span class="calibre5">internal
        cues</span><span> about where our attention is moment to moment. And for this, there is a solution:
      </span><span class="calibre4">pay attention to your attention.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>You Can’t Just </span><span
        class="calibre6">Decide</span><span> to Do This—the Brain Doesn’t Work That Way</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>If you were to participate in one of our lab’s
        studies, here’s what would happen: We’d fit you with a funny little hat that looks like a swim cap,
        elastic and snug, covered in electrodes designed to pick up your brain’s electrical activity. When
        enough of your neurons fire together in response to something we show you on a computer monitor, the
        electrodes detect tiny voltage jolts, which are transmitted to an amplifier, and passed forward to
        another computer to record and process. While all this is transpiring, there we sit, the research team,
        monitoring a screen full of jagged squiggles that shows us, in real time, millisecond by millisecond,
        what’s happening inside your skull. At the same time, we give you computer-based tests to probe
        attention-related behavior.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>In study after study, we looked for
        circumstances in which people could pay attention without getting distracted. And here’s what we found:
        there are none. Across our increasingly targeted experiments, there were </span><span
        class="calibre4">zero</span><span> circumstances in which participants maintained their focus 100
        percent of the time. And a growing body of research now finds that this isn’t unique to our research
        participants—studies from all over the globe find the same pattern. </span><a
        name="epubbookmark40"></a><span>Research participants couldn’t continuously pay attention when they were
        instructed to. They couldn’t do it when the stakes were high or when they were motivated to. They
        couldn’t do it even when they were paid to!</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Let’s pause and take a quick pulse. In the
        very first sentence of this book, I told you that you might miss up to 50 percent of what I was about to
        say. You may have taken that as a challenge to pay extra-close attention. So how’d you do? Think back
        and see if you can take a mental inventory of all the </span><span class="calibre4">other</span><span>
        things you thought about (or even stopped reading to do) since you started reading these pages. You
        might even want to jot them down so you can see how many tasks and thoughts and to-do’s your highly
        active mind is trying to hold all at once. Did you pause to send emails or texts? Did your attention
        turn to concerns about looming deadlines, worries about your kids or parents, plans to see friends, or
        thoughts about your finances? Did you give your dog a quick pat on the head or realize she needs a walk,
        or food, or a bath? Did you stop reading completely to check your news feed?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We all do it. You cannot simply decide to pay
        attention “better.” No matter how much I tell you about how attention works and why, and no matter how
        motivated you are, the way your brain pays attention cannot be fundamentally altered by sheer force of
        will. I don’t care if you’re the most disciplined person alive: </span><span class="calibre4">it will
        not work.</span><span> Instead, we need to train our brains to work </span><span
        class="calibre4">differently.</span><span> And the exciting news is: at long last, we’ve actually
        figured out how.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>The New Science of Attention</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Scientists, scholars, and philosophers have
        long been focused on some key questions: </span><span class="calibre4">What is attention? How does it
        work? Why does it work that way?</span><span> I spent a long time early in my career exploring those
        questions. But I knew we needed to ask the next question: </span><span class="calibre4">How can we make
        it work better?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I started searching for ways that attention
        could be strengthened. We’d tried all kinds of techniques in the lab, from apps offering brain exercises
        to mood-boosting music and even high-tech light-and-sound headsets. Yet, nothing had been consistently
        successful. To make matters worse, we started noticing a troubling pattern in our research with
        high-demand individuals in the field: soldiers, firefighters, and others who operate in high-stakes
        emergency situations. People in these professions often go through intense periods of preparation for
        what they are about to do: Soldiers go through months of intense training before they deploy to war
        zones; firefighters endure rigorous training before facing unpredictable and life-threatening
        situations. Think of anyone preparing for something important. A student studying for her exams. A
        lawyer preparing for trial. A football player in preseason, twice-a-day practices. We found that these
        individuals became attentionally depleted during that preparation period. Their attentional capacity
        took a nose dive. And this was happening right before they had to go out and perform at their
        peak.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>These folks are not unique—a period of
        protracted stress or continuous demand is going to deplete you, leaving you with fewer resources when
        you actually need them most. But before we could devise a </span><span class="calibre4">fix</span><span>, we
        needed to figure out what, exactly, was degrading
        attention.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>One of the biggest culprits? </span><span
        class="calibre4">Mental time travel.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We do it all the time. We do it seamlessly.
        And we do it even more under stress. Under stress, our attention gets yanked into the past by a memory,
        where we get stuck in a ruminative loop. Or we may get launched into the future by a worry, leading us
        to catastrophize on an endless number of doomsday scenarios. The common denominator is that stressful
        intervals hijack attention </span><span class="calibre4">away from the present moment.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>This is how mindfulness first entered my lab
        as a possible “brain-training tool.” I wanted to know whether training our participants in mindfulness
        exercises could help them be more effective in high-pressure situations. Our basic definition of
        mindfulness was this: </span><span class="calibre5" style="font-style:italic">paying attention to
        present-moment experience without conceptual elaboration or emotional reactivity.</span><span> I
        wondered if training people to keep attention in the here and now without editorializing or reacting,
        could serve as a kind of “mental armor.” Could it protect and strengthen their attention for when they
        most needed it?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We worked with mindfulness teachers and
        Buddhist scholars to identify the core mind-training practices that had persevered through the
        centuries. We offered these practices to hundreds of participants, exploring their effects in the lab,
        in the classroom, on the sports field, and on the battlefield. This work led to some exciting moments of
        discovery, and I’ll highlight several of these studies and stories throughout this book. But for now,
        I’ll skip to the end, to the zillion-dollar question: Did it work? Could mindfulness training protect
        and strengthen attention?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The answer was a resounding </span><span
        class="calibre4">yes.</span><span> In fact, mindfulness training was the </span><span
        class="calibre4">only</span><span> brain-training tool that consistently worked to strengthen attention
        across our studies.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Our crisis of attention is fundamentally an
        ancient problem, not a modern one. And an ancient solution—with some very modern updates—is </span><span
        class="calibre4">the</span><span> promising, science-based way out of it.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>New Science, Ancient Solutions</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>As a researcher, my mission has been to bring
        the lens of brain science to the millennia-old practice of mindfulness meditation to explore
      </span><span class="calibre4">if</span><span> and </span><span class="calibre4">how</span><span> it can
        train the brain. What we’ve uncovered is new evidence that, with training, mindfulness </span><span
        class="calibre4">can change the way the brain works by default</span><span> so that our attention—that
        precious resource—is protected and readily available, even in the face of high stress and high
        demand.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We are living in a time of uncertainty and
        change. Many of us are experiencing an atmosphere of stress and threat that constantly activates our
        minds’ tendency to mentally travel to an alternate reality. The more stress and uncertainty we face, the
        more our minds journey to a desired or dystopic mental destination. Often we are in fast-forward mode.
        We’re trying to puzzle through all the uncertainty. We’re mentally planning for events that aren’t
        plannable. We’re gaming out scenarios that may never come to pass.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Sometimes we mentally travel out of the
        present moment because it’s tough to be in it. Military service members tell me, “I don’t want to be in
        this situation. Why should I stay in the present?” We all want to escape sometimes. But as we’ll see in
        the coming chapters, </span><a name="epubbookmark41"></a><span>escapism and other mental coping tactics,
        like positive thinking and suppression (</span><span class="calibre4">Just don’t think about
        it!</span><span>), don’t help us under high-stress circumstances. In fact, they make things
        worse.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We’re missing out on what’s happening right
        here, right now, right in front of us. And not only do we want to experience the moments of our lives,
        we need to be able to </span><span class="calibre4">gather information from the present
        moment,</span><span> to observe and absorb what’s happening in the here and now, so that we can navigate
        the actual future that unfolds, meet challenges as they arise, and be fully present when it matters
        most.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>A Mental Workout That Works</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>At the beginning of this chapter, I told you
        that your mind would wander, that you wouldn’t be able to keep your attention steady all the way
        through—that you’d miss half of what I said. It was, admittedly, meant as a bit of a challenge for you
        to try. But it wasn’t really fair. Imagine that, instead, I’d asked you to pick up the heaviest ball you
        can lift and then hold it in your hands the entire time you were reading, with no warning or
        preparation. Of course, you couldn’t do it for very long without training for this task first—by
        practicing holding up that weight for longer and longer stretches of time.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We tend to accept that, to improve our
        physical health, we need to engage in physical exercise. Somehow, we just don’t think the same way about
        psychological health or cognitive capacity. But we should! Just as specific types of physical training
        can strengthen certain muscle groups, this type of mental training can strengthen attention—</span><span
        class="calibre4">if you do it.</span><span> Lieutenant General Walter (Walt) Piatt—one of the many
        people you’ll meet in these pages who has transformed his life and leadership style through mindfulness
        practice—immediately saw the parallel between physical training and mental training when I started
        working with his troops. He said, “Mindfulness training gave our soldiers push-ups for the mind.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I wish I could just tell you how to reclaim
        your attention, and you could go off and do it. I wish that reading this introduction was all you needed
        to do. But as we’ve seen over and over again, knowledge isn’t enough. Wanting it to be different isn’t
        enough. </span><span class="calibre4">Trying</span><span> isn’t enough. You actually have to train in a
        particular way. Our evolutionary history has primed our minds to work a certain way </span><span
        class="calibre4">by default</span><span>—we can’t simply stop it. Instead, we can train the brain to
        shift away from specific default tendencies that aren’t serving us. We can train our attention to better
        serve us when we need it most.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>And here’s the good news you may have been
        waiting for: you can do this in as little as twelve minutes a day.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The precise science of </span><a
        name="epubbookmark42"></a><span>how much and what kind of mindfulness practice is most beneficial is a
        rapidly developing field. But as of this moment, our research and best understanding of how to train the
        brain indicates that if you engage in regular mindfulness practice, </span><a
        name="epubbookmark43"></a><span>for as little as twelve minutes per day, you can protect against that
        stress- and overwhelm-related decline in attention. If you can do more than twelve minutes? Great! The
        more you do, the more you benefit.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>This book will take you deep into your brain’s
        attention system: how it works, why it’s so critical for everything you do, how and why it gets
        depleted, and what kind of consequences you suffer when it does. Then—like the finely tuned exercises
        that a personal trainer gives you—I’ll take you through specific exercises that target, train, and
        optimize the brain networks of your attention system. By the end, you’ll understand the vulnerabilities
        of attention, and know how to overcome them by training the brain. We’ll start with a “push-up,” and
        build up to a full workout.</span></p>

    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>You Can Start Now—You Have Everything You Need</span>
    </p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>When I started this research, I was on a
        mission to recruit people who had highly demanding, time-pressured, and stressful professional lives.
        One group we partnered with consisted of active-duty military service members, deploying to war zones.
        During active combat, they experienced circumstances that were </span><span
        class="calibre4">volatile</span><span>, </span><span class="calibre4">uncertain</span><span>,
      </span><span class="calibre4">complex</span><span>, and </span><span class="calibre4">ambiguous—</span><span>VUCA
        for short. They helped us put mindfulness training to the
        test. We wanted to know if it could help them under the </span><span class="calibre4">most</span><span>
        challenging circumstances—and it did. But when I began this work back in 2007, I never expected that a
        dozen years later, the whole world would become a VUCA laboratory.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We are all in a period of high demand. It can
        be intense, unpredictable, even scary. And we still need to get through it. Right now, this is what the
        future looks like: it’s going to get more information-dense, more interconnected, more
        technology-reliant. It may even become more divisive and disorienting as we rise to meet the challenges
        of the twenty-first century. If that’s what we’re up against, we need to train as if our lives depend on
        it—because they do. Our goal: not only to survive, but also to thrive. We need to continue to navigate
        toward </span><span class="calibre4">what</span><span> we most want to do, </span><span
        class="calibre4">whom</span><span> we most want to be, and </span><span class="calibre4">how</span><span> we
        want to lead both others and ourselves through the inevitable
        stresses of life, through times of uncertainty.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>People talk a lot about resilience. What
        you’ll learn in this book is really about what I call “pre-silience.” Resilience means bouncing back
        from adversity. But what we want is to train our minds so that we maintain our capacities </span><span
        class="calibre4">even as we are experiencing challenge</span><span>. This means we need something that
        we can start doing right now. And that’s what we have at our fingertips with mindfulness training. You
        don’t need any special equipment. All you need is your mind, your body, and your breath. You can start
        immediately.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>With mindfulness training we can learn to
        protect and strengthen our most precious resource: </span><span class="calibre4">our

        class="calibre4">your</span><span> attention, to know—moment to moment—what your mind is up to, if it’s
        serving you well, and how to intervene if it’s not. As you do, you will build the capacity not only to
        greet moments of joy and awe more fully, but also to rise to the moments of challenge with skill and
        even ease. A riptide can carry you farther out to sea if you fight against it. But if you know how to
        navigate those waters, you can even use that strong current more effectively to get to where you want to

        panic in my voice. My husband looked up, startled. He was sitting up in bed, tapping away at a homework
        assignment on his laptop.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“What?” Michael asked.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“I said </span><span class="calibre4">I can’t
        feel my teeth!</span><span>”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>It was the strangest feeling, a numbness as if
        from novocaine. I was struggling to talk, and I felt a little shaky. How would I eat? How would I
      </span><span class="calibre4">teach?</span><span> I was supposed to be giving a major talk later that week
        on my latest research. What was I going to do—get up on stage in front of hundreds of people and mumble
        as if I’d just had a cavity filled?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Michael asked me to sit down. He tried to talk
        me through it. He suggested that perhaps I needed more rest, and the problem would go away. Had I
        crunched down on something too hard while eating? Did I feel sick in any way?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>He picked up my hand and held it. “What’s
        going on?” he asked gently.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>What </span><span
        class="calibre4">was</span><span> going on? Well, a lot. Our son, Leo, was almost three. As it is for
        many, the first few years of integrating new parenthood into an already busy life had
        been</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.
        well, challenging. I’d finished up a postdoctoral fellowship at Duke University and then landed my very
        first faculty position at the University of Pennsylvania. We relocated, purchasing a hundred-year-old
        fixer-upper in West Philly, which Michael immediately got to work renovating. Now, as an assistant
        professor, I had set up my own lab and was on the tenure track—an arduous process during which you are
        constantly asked to prove your worth and defend your work. I was engaged in the constant, all-consuming
        work of running the lab: writing grants, conducting studies, teaching courses, mentoring students,
        publishing. And Michael, who was working full-time as a computer programmer, had also started a
        demanding graduate program in computer science at Penn. I felt extraordinarily scattered, as if I was
        being pulled in all directions. At the same time, I felt I should be able to just handle it. Our lives
        were demanding, sure, but these were all things we </span><span class="calibre4">wanted</span><span> to
        be doing.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>When I went to the dentist, he said I must be
        grinding my teeth in my sleep.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“It’s probably just stress,” he said. “Have a
        glass of wine to take the edge off.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>One night at bedtime, I began reading Leo his
        favorite book, </span><span class="calibre4">One Fish, Two Fish, Red Fish, Blue Fish</span><span>. A
        short section of this classic Dr. Seuss book was about wumps—the wumps went here, the wumps went there,
        the wumps did this or that. Halfway through the book, my son put his little hand on the page to stop me
        from turning to the next and asked, “What is a wump?”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I opened my mouth to answer him and then
        stopped. I had no idea what a wump was. I was in the middle of reading a book—one I’d read aloud
        probably </span><span class="calibre4">a hundred times,</span><span> and I could not answer the simplest
        question about it. Like one of my undergrad students caught off guard by a pop quiz, I tried to salvage
        the situation, focusing on the page in front of me—what the heck </span><span class="calibre4">was</span><span>
        a wump? It looked like some kind of fuzzy brown lumpy thing, maybe an
        oversize guinea pig? Whatever it was, I had somehow completely missed it, even with my little boy
        nestled in my lap, turning the pages, saying the words.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span class="calibre4">Oh no</span><span>, I
        thought. </span><span class="calibre4">What</span><span> else </span><span class="calibre4">am I
        missing? Am I missing my whole life?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>And if I was this way with my son when he was
        not even three, when he was safe and small and the parenting challenges were also relatively
        minor—getting him to take a nap, coaxing him to eat his vegetables, helping him find his favorite
        toy—then what was going to happen when things got really challenging someday? Was I going to be able to
        be there for him?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>It was ironic. I’d spent years as a devoted
        student of the human brain’s attention system. And now, the lab I ran at a top-notch university was
        entirely dedicated to the study of attention. Our mission was to investigate how attention worked, what
        made it worse, and what made it better. When the university’s media team got requests to interview a
        subject matter expert on the science of attention, they called me. Yet, now, I had no obvious answers
        for myself. I was distracted and unable to grab hold of my own attention. Nothing I’d learned in my
        professional life was helping me with this situation. I was used to being able to “study my way” to
        success, reading everything I could get my hands on to track down an answer, conducting research studies
        to glean scientific insights. This approach had gotten me far in life, my education, and my work—but it
        wasn’t working now.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>For the first time, I couldn’t “logic” my way
        out of a problem. I couldn’t analyze or </span><span class="calibre4">think</span><span> my way back
        from feeling out of step with my life, as hard as I tried. I thought about what I could change to make
        things easier. I thought about my career—the thrill of being on the frontiers of brain science,
        collaborating with smart colleagues, using cutting-edge neuroscience tools, and guiding the next
        generation of scientific minds on their journeys. I thought about my family—the all-encompassing love of
        being a parent and coparenting with the spouse I adore. When I reviewed this life of mine—which was, in
        so many ways, exactly what I wanted—I felt uneasy instead of happy, just as I had when reading my son
        his book. A troubling thought bubbled up: </span><span class="calibre4">I’m not here for this story,
        either.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I was perpetually preoccupied by a blaring,
        unrelenting onslaught of mental chatter, ranging from what I should have done differently on the last
        experiment we ran in the lab, to the most recent lecture I gave, to chasing the next work, parenting, or
        home-renovation demand. It felt like a perfect storm of overwhelm. Yet, I wanted this life. None of
        these very real demands were going to magically vanish anytime soon—nor did I want them to. In that
        moment, I realized something: if I was unwilling to change my life, I was going to have to change my
        brain.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>Can the Brain Really Change?</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I was born in the city of Ahmedabad, in
        Gujarat, a state on the western border of India. It’s notable for being the location of Mahatma Gandhi’s
        ashram—his legacy looms large there. But when I was a baby, my parents moved to the United States so
        that my dad could complete his graduate work in engineering. We lived in the suburbs of Chicago, where
        the neat, straight road grids of the city dissolved into curvy, subdivision cul-de-sacs. In many ways my
        sister and I were like typical American kids growing up in the 1980s—we listened to Wham and Depeche
        Mode, and did our best to look like characters from </span><span class="calibre4">Ferris Bueller’s Day
        Off</span><span>. But inside our house, we were on our own little island, surrounded by the ocean of
        America. Our parents had carried 1970s Indian culture and traditions here with them, and when we were at
        home, that was the world we lived in. Walking out the door to go to school each morning was a little bit
        like crossing a bridge to another world, one with rules and rhythms very different from those within the
        walls of my home.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>As Indian kids, the children of hard-working
        and educated immigrants, my sister and I knew there were but three choices for our eventual professions
        that would be acceptable to our parents: doctor, engineer, or accountant. This was, of course, an almost
        comically restrictive stereotype, but I also knew that their expectations for us to pursue and achieve
        professional success were real. I figured </span><span class="calibre4">doctor</span><span> would be the
        most thrilling, so as a teenager, I declared my intention to get my MD. First step: volunteer in a
        hospital.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>On my first day as a candy striper, I had the
        realization that I absolutely could </span><span class="calibre4">not</span><span> become a doctor. I
        felt uncomfortable, and thoughts of being surrounded by sickness and death were troubling to me. Unlike
        my friends who felt purposeful in that environment, I had to accept that it was not for me—all the bad
        news and uncertainty, the long waits, the fluorescent lights and institutional hallways. But I had
        signed up, so I stuck to my volunteer hours, disliking nearly every single shift—until they sent me down
        to the brain injury unit.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>My job there was to take people who were
        recovering from traumatic brain injuries outside for some fresh air. One of the orderlies would get them
        into a wheelchair (most had varying levels of paralysis), and I would wheel them down the long,
        windowless hallways with their smells of bleach and cafeteria food and through the double doors into the
        fresh air. I got to know one of the patients particularly well. His name was Gordon, and he’d been in a
        motorcycle accident. At first, I thought he was a quadriplegic, paralyzed from the neck down, but as
        time went on, he started to regain the use of one of his arms. Initially, I had to push his wheelchair
        when we went outside. Then, gradually, he started to be able to move his hand </span><span
        class="calibre4">just</span><span> enough to press a little lever on the armrest of an electric
        wheelchair so he could move it forward without my help. I’d walk next to him, in case he had any
        trouble, but he did better and better. He was getting physical therapy to help with the recovery, but he
        told me something else—that at night, when he was lying in bed in the dark, trying to fall asleep, he’d
        vividly imagine the hand motion of pressing that lever in his mind. Even after the hours of physical
        therapy he was receiving, he’d still spend even </span><span class="calibre4">more</span><span> time
        every night going over the motion in his mind, memorizing that muscle movement, repeating it to himself
        like the lyrics to a favorite song he never wanted to forget.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“It exercises my brain!” he would say to me as
        we stuttered along the sidewalk, his hand pressing the lever and then pressing it again and again as he
        rolled along.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>That was it—the moment that it dawned on me. I
        thought, </span><span class="calibre4">Wow, he’s training his brain to be different. He’s actually
        changing his own brain!</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Later, in the midst of my undergraduate
        neuroscience studies, I discovered that professional athletes use this tactic—it’s a known strategy of
        “mental practice” in sports psychology. Even when athletes aren’t physically training, they’ll go over a
        move or motion in their minds as a form of practice. Golfers talk about visualizing their swing, while
        pitchers imagine the pitch, from the first muscle twitch to the last. After the superstar swimmer
        Michael Phelps won one of his gold medals at the Olympics, he described the way he “lives the strokes”
        in his head all the time, even when he’s not in the water. And </span><a name="epubbookmark45"></a><span>brain
        imaging research shows that this mental rehearsal activates the
        motor cortex similar to the way actual physical movement does, exercising and strengthening neural
        networks that control movement, similar to the way physical exercise does for muscles.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>After my stint volunteering in the brain
        injury unit, my fascination with the brain only grew. I became captivated by its fragility, its
        resilience, its capacity for change. I wondered: How does the brain work? How can it control all these
        different functions? How can it adapt and change so radically? How does it manage to be this shifting
        map that can rewrite itself, altering and updating its roads and boundaries—all those things that seemed
        so permanent, as if carved in stone?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Eventually, my pursuit of these questions led
        me to the brain system that has been the passion and focus of my career: </span><span
        class="calibre4">attention.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span class="calibre6">Super-</span><span>powerful</span>
    </p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The attention system performs some of the
        brain’s most powerful functions. It reconfigures the brain’s information processing in important ways
        that allow us to survive and thrive in an ever-complicated, information-dense, and rapidly changing
        world. Like X-ray vision, your attention zooms through a crowded sea of thousands of people, a cacophony
        of sounds and flashing lights, to find your friends and your seat at a concert. Attention gives you the
        ability to </span><span class="calibre4">slow down time</span><span>: you can do everything from
        watching the sun slowly sink over the horizon to meticulously checking your gear before a rock-climbing
        trip or following a checklist or instruction sheet for an intricate job you’re about to perform—as
        medical teams do before surgery—and not miss a thing. (As my military friends put it: “Slow is smooth
        and smooth is fast.”)</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Attention allows you to </span><span
        class="calibre4">time travel</span><span>—you can browse through your happy memories and select one to
        unpack, relive, and savor. You can use it to peer into the future as if clairvoyant, planning and
        dreaming and imagining what fun or exciting things might happen next. Of course, we can’t use our
        attention to move mountains, fly, or walk through walls, but it </span><span class="calibre4">does</span><span>
        allow us to get transported into these thrilling alternate realities,
        either while watching a movie, reading a book, or letting our imaginations run wild. If I haven’t
        convinced you yet that your attention is a superpower, consider what life would be like if your mind
        couldn’t do any of these things: </span><span class="calibre4">superdull</span><span>.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Attention simultaneously highlights what’s
        important and dims distractions so we can think deeply, problem-solve, plan, prioritize, and innovate.
        It’s the portal to learning, taking in new information so we can remember and use it. It’s a key player
        in how we regulate our emotions—and by that I don’t mean suppressing or denying; I mean having awareness
        of our emotions and generating proportionate responses based on our feelings. And attention is the entry
        point to another important system: </span><span class="calibre4">working memory</span><span>, a dynamic
        cognitive workspace that you use for nearly everything you do. (We’ll get into this more deeply in the
        chapters that follow.) Yet perhaps the greatest power attention holds is that it threads together the
        moment-by-moment colors, flavors, textures, insights, memories, emotions, decisions, and actions that
        create the fabric of our lives.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>What you pay attention to </span><span
        class="calibre4">is</span><span> your life.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><a name="epubbookmark46"></a><span>There’s a famous
        study on attention that goes like this: A group of research participants is shown a video of two teams
        on a basketball court, practicing passing and intercepting the ball. One team wears white shirts, the
        other wears black shirts. Participants are told that their job is to count the number of passes between
        the white-shirted players over the course of a few minutes. There are two balls in play, one for each
        team. While moving around, behind, and in front of each other, the black-shirted players pass a ball
        from player to player and the white-shirted players do the same. It’s a little bit hard to track the
        movement of the ball between the white-shirted players, but if you really focus you can do it. At the
        end of the video, the researcher asks the study group: “How many passes did you count?”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Anybody who answers “Fifteen” is correct. But
        there’s another question.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“Did you see the gorilla?”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The response to that is usually total
        confusion. </span><span class="calibre4">What gorilla?!</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>When the video is rewound, it’s obvious:
        halfway through, a person in a gorilla suit strolls into the middle of the basketball game, stops and
        waves (or even does a little dance, in some variations—this study has been run many times), and then
        meanders offscreen. </span><span class="calibre4">And nobody sees it.</span><span> If you’re thinking to
        yourself, “Well, </span><span class="calibre4">I’d</span><span> see it—there’s no way I’d miss a
        gorilla!” then consider this: This demo was run with a group of astronauts at NASA, arguably some of the
        most intelligent, highly focused people on the planet. Did any of them see the gorilla? Nope.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>When scientists talk about this study, they
        usually discuss it as a </span><span class="calibre4">failure</span><span> of attention. It’s a “gotcha”
        moment at the end of the activity—you missed something you should have noticed: </span><span
        class="calibre4">fail</span><span>! However, I see it as an example of how incredibly powerful your
        attention can be. It shows that your attention system can be highly effective at shutting out
        distractions. In this instance, you were given a mission—count the passes—so you focused on those white
        shirts and filtered out anything dark, including that gorilla. To me, that sounds like an incredible
      </span><span class="calibre4">strength</span><span> of attention. It’s so effective at illuminating the
        relevant and blocking out the irrelevant that it made a dancing gorilla invisible.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>But this next point is important: your
        attention system is doing this constantly—highlighting certain things and shutting out others. It was my
        attention system’s capacity to do this that was messing with me during those overwhelming teeth-numbing
        months. I had “selected” certain things to focus on—worries about work, the house, the future—and
        everything else was dimmed: my husband, my son, the rest of my life.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We all need to be asking ourselves:</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span class="calibre4">What is my attention
        highlighting right now?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span class="calibre4">What is it shutting
        out?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span class="calibre4">And how does this factor into
        the experience I have of my life?</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>This Is Your Brain on Attention</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Your brain is built for bias. That might sound
        like a bad thing—immediately we think of biases based on race, gender, sexual orientation, age, or any
        number of other aspects of someone’s core personhood that lead to unjust mistreatment or privilege—but
        this isn’t the bias I’m talking about right now. By </span><span class="calibre4">built for
        bias</span><span>, I mean that the brain does not treat all information it encounters equally. And as a
        matter of fact, neither do you. Maybe you like the color green more than the color blue, or dark
        chocolate more than milk chocolate, deep house or country music more than classical. You can probably
        think up all kinds of explanations (from your past, your relationships, your experiences, and so on) for
        why you have these particular preferences, but when it comes to how the brain functions, </span><span
        class="calibre4">evolutionary pressures</span><span> are actually what have led to many of its
        biases.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Here’s an example: We humans can see better
        than we can smell. Meanwhile, our dogs can smell better than they can see. Why? Our ancestors thousands
        of years ago almost certainly relied on sight more than smell to survive—and vice versa with our furry
        friends. </span><a name="epubbookmark47"></a><span>How much of your brain do you think is devoted to
        vision? Take a guess. And keep in mind that the brain has many functions outside of vision. Five
        percent? Ten percent? Twenty-five percent?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The answer is </span><span class="calibre4">50
        percent.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>A full half of your brain is devoted to one
        job: visual perception. So, right off the bat, your brain is </span><span class="calibre4">biased</span><span>
        toward visual cues over other sensory inputs</span><span class="calibre4">.</span><span> Then it gets even more
        intense.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Look up from this page for a minute and keep
        your head and eyes facing straight ahead. You just experienced your “field of view”: the extent of the
        observable world that is possible for you to see at any moment in time. For humans who have two
        functioning eyes, that field of view is about 200 degrees. So if you were to draw a big 360-degree
        circle around yourself, you can perceive a little more than half of that range. And the place where you
        have the best acuity is right smack at the center of your field of view. This little wedge is the only
        region where we have 20/20 vision. And when I say “little,” I mean </span><span
        class="calibre4">little.</span><span> Out of those 200 degrees that you can perceive, you have high
        visual acuity in just </span><span class="calibre4">two</span><span> of them.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Try this: Take both of your arms and extend
        them out in front of you. Now hold up both thumbs so they are side by side, touching. The width of your
        two thumbnails next to each other is roughly two degrees. That’s it—that’s the narrow little slice of
        your visual field that has high acuity. If you don’t believe me, try gradually moving your thumbs apart,
        while keeping your eyes steady. Very quickly you’ll notice that things get fuzzy. To keep both thumbs
        crisp and clear, you have to dart your eyes back and forth, which is basically rapidly shifting your
        field of view, again and again, so that each thumb is briefly in the center again.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Those two degrees of high visual acuity you
        have? They rely on 50 percent of the cells in your brain’s visual cortex. The reason I’m mentioning this
        is to illustrate exactly how much bias there really </span><span class="calibre4">is</span><span> in
        your brain, all the time, no matter what you’re doing: your brain is </span><span
        class="calibre4">biased</span><span> toward visual information. And it’s even more biased toward that
        tiny slice of your visual field. Whatever’s in those precious two degrees is going to have a massive
        overrepresentation in your brain.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Representation of your body in your brain is
        also highly biased. You won’t be all that surprised to learn that we have many more neurons devoted to
        tactile sensation on our fingertips compared to the forearm. Which would you rather use to feel the soft
        fur of a cute bunny, your fingertips or your arm? Reach out right now and touch something textured—a
        blanket, your sweater, anything. Stroke it with the back of your hand; then stroke it with your
        fingertips. Notice the difference. This is you having </span><span class="calibre4">direct
        contact</span><span> with one of your brain’s “biases.” Many more neurons are involved and firing as
        your fingertips touch your sweater compared to other parts of your hands or arms.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>These built-in structural biases we have in
        the brain are essential. They were born out of the evolutionary pressures endured by our ancestors to
        advantage their survival. We rely on them all the time: think of moving your eyes to the doorway to
        check who’s coming in. Our gaze and our attention are tightly yoked, like dancing partners always in
        step. Moving our gaze is often how we direct attention and how we show others (including your dog) where
        our attention is. Eye gaze is an incredibly powerful social cue.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>However, having your eyes somewhere doesn’t
        guarantee that your attention is there too or that information processing will be successful—think about
        the last time you zoned out in the middle of a conversation. In other words: you could be petting that
        bunny without really feeling the soft fur; you could be looking at your child’s face without hearing
        what he’s saying. Why? Because inside your own brain, there is a continuous battle unfolding over which
        information gets processed versus which gets suppressed. And </span><span
        class="calibre4">attention</span><span> is the powerful force that can tip the scale.</span></p>

        Fight</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The brain is a war zone where neurons, nodes
        (clusters of neurons), and networks (interconnected nodes, like a subway map with hubs) compete for
        prominence, fighting to suppress each other’s activity. Sometimes they form alliances, enhancing each
        other’s activity; other times they go to war with each other. Nodes can exert more influence than
        individual neurons, and even more so when they link up into networks, like a national political party
        opening offices across the country, solidifying its influence into a coherent message and strong
        collective action. There are multiple networks warring for prominence in your brain at any moment in
        time.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Forget the myth that you only use 10 percent
        of your brain. One hundred percent of your brain is active right now, with all of its 86 billion
        neurons—organized into nodes and networks—coordinating, enhancing, and suppressing each other. As the
        activity of one network goes up, another’s is tamped down. This is mostly a very good thing! If the
        network activity tied to moving your hand in an </span><span class="calibre4">upward</span><span>
        direction didn’t suppress network activity for </span><span class="calibre4">downward</span><span>
        movement, you would not be able to move your hand. In fact, this is the kind of thing that can happen
        with </span><a name="epubbookmark48"></a><span>certain neurodegenerative diseases that impair cognition,
        movement, vision, and more—neurons lose their clear marching orders and stop coordinating the way
        they’re supposed to.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>In the brain wars, we </span><span
        class="calibre4">want</span><span> to have definitive winners and losers in the moment-to-moment
        dynamics of brain function. This allows us to do everything from moving our bodies to pursuing certain
        lines of thought and not others.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>In my lab, we use complex visual items like
      </span><span class="calibre4">faces</span><span> and </span><span class="calibre4">scenes</span><span> to
        explore perception and attention. Faces are special. There is a unique electrical brain signature that
        we can index by putting electrodes on your scalp. Our recording equipment reliably picks it up 170
        milliseconds after you are shown an image of a human face. And the amplitude of the signal—in other
        words, the voltage that is produced by the sheer number of neurons that fire together in response to the
        face—is high. It’s a strong, reliable brain signature. We call it the N170.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>If I were to show you the image of a face
        while recording the ongoing electrical activity in your brain, I’d see a strong N170 from you. If I
        showed you a second face half a second later, I’d see another strong N170. But </span><a
        name="epubbookmark49"></a><span>if I showed you two faces at the same time, the N170 would suddenly drop
        to being smaller in amplitude. It immediately shrinks and weakens.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>That seems very strange—why would </span><span
        class="calibre4">more</span><span> visual information lead to a </span><span
        class="calibre4">smaller</span><span> brain response? Answer: </span><span class="calibre4">the brain
        wars</span><span>! The groups of neurons processing each face </span><span class="calibre4">suppress
        each other.</span><span> We get a weaker signal because the faces are in competition for our neural
        activity. As a result, neither face gets processed well.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span class="calibre4">So what?</span><span> Well,
        consider the consequences for our experience of the world: the amount of neural activity determines the
        richness of the perceptual experience we have. Our ability to perceive details, or act based on what we
        perceive, is tied to the activity of our perceptual neurons. Think of the last Zoom call you were on. If
        it was a call with one other person, you probably had a sharp read on their expressions, their
        appearance. But if you had a fifteen-person meeting, it might have felt both fuzzy and overwhelming.
        With more faces, there will be even more inhibition driving down and compromising the richness of your
        perception. And this is true for anything—not just faces. Everything around us is competing for brain
        activity at all times.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>This is where </span><span
        class="calibre4">attention</span><span> becomes the superhero.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Let’s come back to those two faces. This time,
        I tell you to </span><span class="calibre4">pay attention</span><span> to the face on the left. You
        aren’t allowed to move your eyes—keep them perfectly still while shifting your attention to the left
        face. What we’d see in the lab is that even though there are still two faces on the screen, and nothing
        has changed, you will be much better at perceiving and reporting back information regarding the left
        face. </span><span class="calibre4">Paying attention</span><span> to the face boosts the activity of the
        corresponding neurons, and more activity means more richness of perception. It won the fight! And
        attention is what determined the winner.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Here’s the recap: </span><span
        class="calibre4">attention biases brain activity.</span><span> It gives a competitive advantage to the
        information it selects. Whatever it is you pay attention to will have more neural activity associated
        with it. Your attention, quite literally, </span><span class="calibre4">alters the functioning of your
        brain at the cellular level.</span><span> It truly is a superpower.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span class="calibre6">Attention</span><span> Is Not Just
        One Thing</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>So far I’ve been talking about </span><span
        class="calibre4">attention</span><span> as if it were a single brain system—one that you can direct
        somewhere to selectively enhance information processing. But this is only one form of attention.
      </span><a name="epubbookmark50"></a><span>There are actually three subsystems that work together to allow us
        to fluidly and successfully function in our complex world.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead1" style="margin:20.25pt 5pt 10.8pt"><span>The Flashlight</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Your attention can be like a flashlight. Where
        you point it becomes brighter, highlighted, more salient. Whatever’s not in the flashlight’s beam? That
        information remains suppressed—it stays dampened, dimmed, and blocked out. Attention researchers call
        this your </span><span class="calibre4">orienting system,</span><span> and it’s what you use to select
        information. You can point that flashlight beam anywhere: outward at your external environment, or
        inward, to your own thoughts, memories, emotions, body sensations, and the like. We have this fantastic
        capacity to willfully direct and select with this flashlight of ours. We can shine it at a person we’re
        with, into the past or into the future—anywhere we want, we can point it.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead1" style="margin:20.25pt 5pt 10.8pt"><span>The Floodlight</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>This is, in some ways, the opposite of the
        flashlight. Where the flashlight is narrow and focused, this subsystem, called the </span><span
        class="calibre4">alerting system</span><span>, is broad and open. I have a giant floodlight above my
        garage door. It’s not always on, but when the motion detector gets triggered, on it goes. When I look
        out my window, I can scan to see what’s happening. Is there a package? A racoon? A visitor? My attention
        is ready for whatever or whomever it is. Think of what happens when you see a flashing yellow light as
        you’re driving—you immediately go “on alert” as your attention system shines its floodlight. Diffuse and
        ready, just like me looking out my window at home, it has a broad, receptive stance. You are now in a
        state of vigilance. You’re not sure what you’re looking for, but you know you’re looking for
      </span><span class="calibre4">something,</span><span> and you’re ready to rapidly deploy your attention in
        any direction as you respond. What you’re alerted to could be something in your environment, or it could
        be a thought or emotion generated from within.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead1" style="margin:20.25pt 5pt 10.8pt"><span>The Juggler</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>To direct, oversee, and manage what we’re
        doing, moment to moment, as well as ensure that our </span><span class="calibre4">actions</span><span>
        are aligned with </span><span class="calibre4">what we’re aiming to do</span><span>: this is the job of
        the juggler. This subsystem is what people are referring to when they talk about “executive function,”
        and the formal name for it is actually the “central executive.” This is the overseer that makes sure we
        stay on track. We may be aiming to accomplish microgoals that are near-term, such as finish reading this
        chapter, draft an email, clean up the kitchen. Or we may have big long-term goals, like train for a
        marathon, raise happy children, earn a promotion. No matter how big the goal or how far away it is on
        the horizon, there will always be challenges along the way, distractions to overcome, competing forces
        to contend with. So we will need to navigate multiple demands at once.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The central executive functions like a
        juggler, keeping all the balls in the air. The juggler’s job isn’t to do everything itself. It’s to make
        sure that the whole operation is fluidly ongoing. It’s to match up </span><span
        class="calibre4">goals</span><span> with </span><span class="calibre4">behaviors</span><span> to make
        sure those goals get accomplished. Example: Your goal is to finish a time-sensitive project by 6:00 p.m.
        But instead, you’re on a group chat until 5:00 p.m., planning an event six months away. That’s a failure
        of the central executive: your juggler has lost track of your current goal. It failed to override the
        pull of your phone as the pinging messages came in one after another in rapid fire. Soon your behavior
        no longer aligns with what you wanted to accomplish. Now multiply that by all the things you need to
        accomplish in a day, a week, a
        month</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Importantly, you use your juggler to
      </span><span class="calibre4">override automatic tendencies</span><span> (like picking up that phone at
        every ping), as well as to update and revise a goal based on new information that’s come in, and to
        refresh the goal to remind you of what you are aiming to do. Override. Update. Refresh. Every time we do
        any of these things, we’re engaging our </span><span class="calibre4">central executive.</span><span>
        The more tasks you’re planning and managing, the more you rely on this form of attention. Sometimes,
        you’re juggling and somebody throws another ball (task) at you—you have no choice but to deal with it.
        It might bump another ball out of orbit. Or maybe you chose to keep picking up more and more balls,
        thinking you can handle them all—and maybe you can, depending on how well your juggler is able to align
        your behaviors and goals.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>As effective as your attention can be when
        it’s in any of these three modes, it won’t typically operate in multiple modes at once. For instance, it
        can’t really be the flashlight </span><span class="calibre4">and</span><span> the floodlight in the same
        moment. Think of a time when you’ve been deeply focused and engaged in an activity. If someone were to
        walk up and speak to you right then, it might take you a few extra seconds just to realize that
        something had been said, much less be able to start the process of deciphering what was actually said!
        (How many times have you looked up from a book, your phone, video game screen, or laptop, and said,
        “What?”) That’s </span><span class="calibre4">high-orienting, low-alerting functioning</span><span>:
        your flashlight was so fixed on its target that everything else—from sights and sounds in your
        environment to random thoughts generated in your mind—went dark.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Now imagine walking home and taking a shortcut
        down a dark and deserted alley. Before, you were deep in thought planning out your day tomorrow, but now
        you drop that mental activity and shift into high alert, scanning for possible threats. That’s
      </span><span class="calibre4">high-alerting, low-executive functioning</span><span>—the floodlight is on,
        and the juggler’s got only one job: to manage your safety.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>If you’re “on alert” for whatever reason (you
        don’t have to </span><span class="calibre4">be</span><span> threatened, you just have to </span><span
        class="calibre4">feel</span><span> threatened), you won’t be able to focus or plan. And while it might
        seem like it, this is not actually a failing of attention. This is exactly how attention is supposed to
        work, so that we can:</span></p>

        we often mean is </span><span class="calibre4">focus.</span><span> But attention is about so much more
        than that. Attention is a currency, a multipurpose resource. We need it for nearly every aspect of our
        lives, and each form that it takes (the flashlight, the floodlight, the juggler) is relevant for
        everything we do. We’ve talked about how attention enables you to perceive the environment around you.

        few key reasons. One is the human brain’s natural, millennia-old tendencies—some of which we may find

        whatever method of </span><span class="calibre4">doom scrolling</span><span> you prefer. Even though our
        participants were doing the same “pay attention” task, their ability to distinguish between “relevant”

        then a captain in the US Marines who recently returned from Iraq, is driving across a long bridge. The
        view from the bridge is gorgeous. The sun is bright on the water, the sky cloudless and perfect—that
        color of blue that always seems impossible. But Davis isn’t seeing any of it. Instead, his mind is
        occupied with scenes of dusty roads and fields of dirt: deep shadows that seem to move. His body is
        flooded with stress hormones as he feels the same anxiety he used to feel as he drove those roads. His
        body is on that bridge in Florida, his foot pressing harder and harder on the gas pedal, the car
        dangerously picking up speed. But his mind—his attention—is halfway around the globe, in Iraq, and he
        can’t pull it back. What he wants more than anything is to turn the wheel just slightly and drive right
        off that bridge. It takes everything he has not to do it.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>What we see Captain Davis experiencing in this

        certainly more extreme and consequential than what most of us may experience, attentional hijacking is
        quite common. Your attention, that spotlight created by your mind, is constantly being yanked away from
        where you want it to be and onto something else, something that your mind, in all its complexity, has
        decided is more “relevant” and “urgent”—even if that’s the furthest thing from true.</span></p>

        you’re keeping them fixed straight ahead as we’ve instructed. And most important, to make sure all the

    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I recently went hunting for a set of

        looked promising, but nothing was exactly what I wanted. The next day, when I opened Gmail, an ad banner
        said, </span><span class="calibre4">“Hello cookware enthusiast!”</span><span> When I checked my social

          heard the company name before. My attention was immediately and powerfully biased by prior history.
          That familiar name leapt out and pulled my flashlight like a magnet.</span></li>
      <li class="bul" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:41pt"><span class="calibre5"
          style="font-style:italic">Salience.</span><span> The second time I clicked, I was sucked in by the
          physical features of the ad. The color, the flashing, the size of the text—all of these physical
          features of the ad were screaming </span><span class="calibre4">LOOK AT ME!</span><span> Salience
          (novelty, loud noises, bright lights and colors, motion) yanks us toward that stimulus—we can’t
          resist. </span><span class="calibre4">Salience</span><span> is tailor-made for each of us—seeing my
          name, “AMISHI,” got me—which is precisely why so many apps ask us to customize our profiles. We are
          gripped by personally relevant stuff. Our attention moves—fast and ballistic. It is easily
          captured.</span></li>
      <li class="bul" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:41pt; margin-bottom:14.4pt"><span class="calibre5"
          style="font-style:italic">Our own goal.</span><span> Finally, our attention can be “goal-driven,”
          biased by our own chosen goal. Mine was to find high-quality, affordable pans, so I finally
          restricted my online search terms to show only those options. This is </span><span
          class="calibre4">exactly</span><span> how attention works when we have a goal in mind: </span><span
          class="calibre4">it restricts our perception based on that goal.</span><span> But my pan-hunting
          example also highlights a weakness: our goals are the most vulnerable of all these “attentional

    </ol>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>This was a battle for my </span><span

        magnet drawing it; it was yanked by salience. Ultimately, my goal won the battle—but it took a lot of
        time and a few detours before I ended up with what I wanted and needed. This isn’t just about buying
        pans, of course: it can happen with anything we set out to do. Attention is a superpower, but we often
        have very little awareness of where it is and who or what is in control, not to mention how or when it
        gets deployed. And on top of that, we spend much of our lives—as we navigate not just the internet but
        also our careers, our relationships, and all the curveballs life has to offer—under conditions that are
        like </span><span class="calibre4">kryptonite</span><span> for our attentional superpower.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>What Is “Kryptonite”?</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Three major forces degrade our attention:
      </span><span class="calibre4">stress, poor mood,</span><span> and </span><span
        class="calibre4">threat</span><span>. It’s not always possible to pick them apart—they often function in
        unison, working together to thwack at the attention system. But I’ll take you through them one by one so
        we can look at how, and why, these forces can disrupt your attention catastrophically.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead1" style="margin:20.25pt 5pt 10.8pt"><span>Stress</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>That perceived feeling of being overwhelmed
        that we call </span><span class="calibre4">stress</span><span> fuels mental time travel. We experience a
        skyrocketing of attentional hijacking, like Captain Davis did on that bridge. The tendency of our minds
        to get pulled by a memory or worry, and to incessantly create stories, takes us away from the here and
        now as our stress increases. You’re ruminating on something that occurred in the past, long after the
        time when reliving it is helpful or instructive. Or you’re worrying about things that not only haven’t
        happened yet, but may never happen. And this only serves to aggravate and accelerate the amount of
        stress you’re under. When you experience too much stress for too long, you get caught in the downward
        spiral of attention degradation: the worse attention gets, the less you’re able to control it; the less
        you’re able to control it, the worse stress gets.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>How much stress is “too much” can be pretty
        individual and subjective. For a lot of the people I work with—and this might be true for you, too—the
        idea of stress as a problem doesn’t immediately resonate. They see stress as a powerful motivator,
        something that challenges and inspires them to overcome, push harder, strive for excellence. I get that.
      </span><a name="epubbookmark58"></a><span>Take a look at the graph </span><a href="#epubbookmark59"
        style="text-decoration:none"><span class="calibre1">below</span></a><span>, which shows how stress
        intersects with performance. What it suggests is that, indeed, when our stress is low—when we have
        nothing driving us, no immediate deadlines for example—our performance isn’t that great, but as our
        stress increases, we rise to the challenge. This type of “good” stress, called </span><span
        class="calibre4">eustress</span><span> (pronounced “you-stress”), is a powerful engine for performance,
        all the way up to the very top of that chart, where we reach the optimum level (what I affectionately
        call the “sweet spot”) where stress is a positive motivator, something that drives and focuses
        us.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>If we could stay here forever, we’d be all
        set. But the reality is that even this optimum amount of stress, if experienced over a long enough
        period, starts to push us over that hill and into the long slope down, where </span><span
        class="calibre4">eustress</span><span> becomes </span><span class="calibre4">distress.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Even if stress begins as motivating or
        productive, the longer we’re under high-demand conditions, the more that ongoing stress is going to
        affect us. We’ll start to tip over the optimum stress point and drop down the far side of the stress
        curve. We rapidly lose any benefits from the stress we’re experiencing, and it becomes a corrosive,
        degrading force on our attention. More and more, your flashlight gets stuck on negative thoughts. Your
        alerting system amps up so that </span><span class="calibre4">everything</span><span> you encounter
        feels like a flashing caution sign, pulling you into a hypervigilant mode, making it impossible to focus
        deeply on anything. And your central executive, the juggler, drops balls so what you </span><span
        class="calibre4">want</span><span> to do and what you </span><span class="calibre4">actually</span><span> do no
        longer match; your actions and goals fall out of alignment.
        And as all this happens, there’s a natural consequence: mood plummets.</span></p>

    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Everything from chronic depression to how you
        feel after receiving bad news can constitute </span><span class="calibre4">poor mood.</span><span>
        Whatever the source, the effect can be to send you into loops of repetitive negative thought. In the
        lab, when we induce a negative mood in study participants, performance on attention tests
        declines.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>How do we “induce a negative mood”? Sometimes
        we show participants upsetting images, similar to those in the study I mentioned earlier. Or we may ask
        people to conjure up a negative memory. Then we give them cognitive tasks that tax attention and working
        memory—such as remembering a few letters and then doing a math problem in their head. </span><a

    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>When you’re under threat—or feel that you
        are—it can be impossible to focus on the task-at-hand or pursue any goal or plan. That flashlight I
        described to you in </span><a href="#epubbookmark8" style="text-decoration:none"><span class="calibre1">chapter
          1</span></a><span>? Your powerful ability to direct your attention at will?
        Poof. Gone. Imagine that steady, brilliant beam of light now haphazardly shaking about, and all of that
        focus scattering to the shadows. Whatever you were trying to do? It’s not going to happen.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Under threat, attention is reconfigured in two
        ways: (1) threat vigilance increases, and (2) attention becomes </span><span
        class="calibre4">stimulus-driven</span><span>, so that anything that is threat-related captures and
        holds attention. There’s an obvious survival reason for this: at pivotal points in human evolution, high
        vigilance was a requirement, otherwise you wouldn’t survive to pass on your genes. If you were too
        absorbed in a task to notice a predator stalking you, that was pretty much it. A sense of being
        threatened had to trigger a rapid switch to being on “high alert.” And, as extra life insurance,
        evolution doubled down so that the threatening stimulus would capture and hold your focus, ensuring that
        your attention remained steadfastly and compulsively fixated on it—which allowed you to stay on the
        watch for a predator and, if you saw one, to know where it was at all times. This probably saved our
        ancestors’ lives many times over. But it had other consequences that explain why they never wrote
        brilliant tomes or designed complex machines. </span><a name="epubbookmark61"></a><span>If you feel
        threatened all the time, you aren’t going to be able to engage deeply in any other task or experience.
        And it doesn’t matter whether the “threat” in question is a literal one or a metaphorical one.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>When we study threat in the lab, we don’t put
        people in situations where they truly feel their physical safety is at risk—that wouldn’t be ethical.
        However, plenty of people that I work with do face true threats to their physical safety: a soldier
        going into combat or a live-fire training exercise, or a fire jumper confronting a dangerous blaze in
        high winds. For most of us, threat will be less literal—but that doesn’t mean its impact on our
        attention will be less. A meeting with a supervisor regarding a performance review, a dispute with your
        insurance company, testifying at a public hearing with city officials regarding a new ordinance that
        affects your neighborhood—these types of circumstances, while not representing threats to our physical
        safety, can still be threatening. Our reputation, financial well-being, or sense of justice can all be
        under threat.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Even if you have the highest IQ on the block,
        here’s a truth about human brains: in some ways, </span><a name="epubbookmark62"></a><span>they haven’t
        changed in thirty-five thousand years. If the brain believes it’s under threat</span><span
        class="calibre4">,</span><span> it’s going to reconfigure attention accordingly, regardless of whether
        what’s actually in front of you </span><span class="calibre4">is</span><span> a threat.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>Kryptonite Is Sneaky</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Even if you haven’t visited a neuroscience lab
        or seen the scientific evidence from study after study, it probably makes sense to you that stress, poor
        mood, and threat are tough on your attention. </span><span class="calibre4">Okay</span><span>, we think,
      </span><span class="calibre4">then I’ll just reduce stress, keep an eye on my mood, and make sure I’m not
        feeling threatened by stuff that isn’t really a threat.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The fact is, we’re really bad at identifying
        forces that degrade attention, even when we’re immersed in them. We often aren’t able to recognize them
        for what they are. And further, without training to gain a stronger awareness of our own minds, we
        simply aren’t very cognizant of the effects.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Here’s a good example: </span><span
        class="calibre4">stereotype threat</span><span>. It happens when societal preconceptions about some
        aspect of one’s identity—often related to gender, ethnicity, or age—function as an obstacle to our
        performance or well-being. </span><a name="epubbookmark63"></a><span>A study on Asian undergraduate
        women played two common stereotypes against each other: one, that females are inherently bad at math;
        the other, that Asians are naturally skilled at math. One group of students was asked to record their
        gender before taking a mathematics test: they simply had to write down “female.” The other group was
        asked instead to indicate only their ethnicity. The group that was “primed” to hold their ethnicity in
        mind performed well on the test, while the group set up to identify with their gender performed more
        poorly.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>And there’s a twist: it’s not just when the
        stereotype is “bad” that performance suffers. In a related study, researchers emphasized an expectation
        that the participants would do well on a test (“Asians are good at math”)—and yet they ended up doing
        poorly! In that instance, the </span><span class="calibre4">high</span><span> expectation based on the
        stereotype also functioned as a threat—the “threat” being that they might not live up to those
        expectations and would fail to confirm that positive stereotype. Stereotype threat can swing both ways:
        you might promote the </span><span class="calibre4">low</span><span>-opinion stereotype (“women can’t do
        math”), or you might (or might not) promote the high expectation (“Asians are great at math”). Either
        case threatens some core part of your identity, and that threat shatters your focus. And finally, across
        all studies, the pattern was only observed in participants who knew of the stereotype—if you feel you
        are a member of that group, it will hurt you.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Why is this important? Because it highlights
        why stereotypes become a threat to attention: it’s </span><span class="calibre4">preoccupying.</span><span> “I’m
        getting older, so I’ll be slow and forgetful,” or “I’m
        too young to be respected as a leader”—these are distractions because they function, in our brain’s
        attention system, as threats. We take on a major cognitive burden when worrying about confirming the low
        expectations of others—or failing to confirm the high ones.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Stereotype threat played a role in a pivotal
        moment in my own life. As an undergrad student in neuroscience, I once worked in a lab that focused on
      </span><span class="calibre4">theory of mind</span><span>—the ability to attribute mental states to oneself
        and others, and to understand that others have perceptions different from one’s own. I found it
        fascinating and considered pursuing this research topic in grad school. The professor who ran the lab
        was a senior faculty member in the department, well-respected. At the end of my junior year, after a
        year in his lab, I went to him for advice on which graduate programs I might apply to. I remember the
        look on his face: he was surprised, and then dubious.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“You’re going to grad school?” he asked.
        “Women from your culture don’t typically go on to have professional lives.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I remember how hard it hit me—that when he
        looked at me, he saw my gender and some antiquated version of my culture. Not a talented young student
        with a lot of potential.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>When I left his lab that semester, I never
        went back. There was a fantastic class I had just finished, one of my favorites in my major, with a
        professor named Dr. Patti Reuter-Lorenz, who I thought was articulate, brilliant, clear, funny, and,
        frankly, a real rock star. She’d taught through her third trimester of pregnancy. She was strong,
        energetic, and undaunted. At the beginning of my senior year, I contacted her and asked if she had any
        space in her lab, which
        studied</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.
      </span><span class="calibre4">attention.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>That incident set me on my life course. I felt
        the gut punch of stereotype threat, and I wasn’t willing to operate under those kinds of contrary
        conditions—ones that I knew wouldn’t be conducive to learning and success. If I could speak to that
        first professor now, I’d thank him—for alerting me to his true colors, just in time for me to change
        course and find this work, which has changed my life in so many ways.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Think of all the ways you might categorize
        yourself—by gender, race, sexual identity, ability or disability, weight, appearance, socioeconomic
        background, educational background, nationality, religion, work experience or inexperience. No matter
        the historical or prejudicial forces driving our experience of stereotype threat, when we feel it, it
        undermines our performance, our goal achievement, and even our overall psychological well-being. This is
        the cultural soup we live in. As great as it would be if we could just drain it away, we can’t.
        Stereotype threat can put us constantly “on alert” in ways that keep our attention diffused, shallow,
        and unable to focus.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Stress can also be sneaky.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>When Stress Doesn’t Feel Like Stress</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Recently, I gave a presentation on my work to
        the president of my university, the University of Miami, Dr. Julio Frenk. He had heard about my team’s
        research and was interested in the possibility of having us offer a mindfulness training program for his
        leadership cabinet. But if his team members were going to spend time on something like this, he needed
        more information about what they stood to gain.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>So I delivered a one-on-one briefing, and
        began by describing the cognitive costs of high-stress intervals. He listened attentively, but when I
        was done talking about the damage that these attention-degrading factors can do, he had a
        question.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“But what if I’m </span><span
        class="calibre4">not</span><span> stressed?”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>He acknowledged that he had a lot going on.
        But it didn’t feel like </span><span class="calibre4">stress.</span><span> He wasn’t feeling that sense
        of overwhelm, urgency, panic, or any of the typical emotions associated with stress. He described it
        instead as “a lot of things happening in the background that pull me away.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I nodded. It made sense that someone at his
        level wouldn’t experience “stress” in the usual way. Often, high-achieving, high-performing leaders
        don’t identify their experience as stressful. While he understood the concept of one’s attention getting
        hijacked by preoccupations, the notion of “stress” simply didn’t resonate with him.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>As I knew from work in the lab, you don’t have
        to be </span><span class="calibre4">feeling</span><span> stressed for attention to be compromised.
      </span><a name="epubbookmark64"></a><span>Many things leaders deal with—high-cognitive demands, evaluative
        pressure, tense social interactions, uncertainty—are known to degrade attention, as well. </span><a
        name="epubbookmark65"></a><span>In a recent study, participants were told that they </span><span
        class="calibre4">might</span><span> have to give a speech after completing an attentionally demanding
        task that would take several minutes. These participants had poorer task performance than those who were
        told that they would </span><span class="calibre4">not</span><span> have to give a speech. That might
        not be surprising. But here is what was: the “uncertain” group’s task performance was worse than a third
        group that was told they would definitely be giving a speech—suggesting that the uncertainty itself adds
        a preoccupying cognitive load that further depletes attention.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>This research tells us that it doesn’t have to
        feel like stress for it to degrade our attention. I knew it from my own personal experience, as well. I
        hadn’t identified what I was going through during my teeth-numbing episode as “stress”—I never would
        have labeled it that way.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>You might just be feeling like your plate is
        extremely full, so much so that you start to notice some challenges in isolating and homing in on the
        most important priorities, or in maintaining that mental clarity you need to function at the top of your
        game.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We’re all going to have varying levels of
        stress tolerance (also called “distress tolerance”). You might not experience your life as stressful.
        But know that when the demands on you are intensive and protracted (from a few weeks to months), in all
        likelihood they’re having an impact on your attention. Call it “high demand” if that feels right for
        you. What we’re talking about here is “demand” as a tipping point, when you go past what is comfortable
        or productive. When there is more going on than your attention system (in its current state) is able to
        handle, you’re far more prone to discomfort and dysfunction.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Regardless of how you label it, periods of
        high demand can have a corrosive effect on your attention. Is the obvious solution, then, to avoid the
        offending circumstances? To set lower expectations? To achieve less? To scale down demands?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>My answer is a resounding </span><span
        class="calibre4">no</span><span>. Many stressors are unavoidable, while others are part of our journey
        to fulfillment and success—if we removed them, we would be limiting ourselves. I’m not here to tell you
        to change your life, switch careers, or lower your expectations for yourself as a professional, a
        parent, a community organizer, an athlete—whatever it is that you’ve set out to become. I wasn’t willing
        to do that, and I’m betting you aren’t, either. This book is not about reducing your demands to optimize
        attention, or learning how to say no. It’s about optimizing </span><span class="calibre4">in the face
        of</span><span> stress, challenge, and high demand. Things worth doing are demanding. Our jobs are
        demanding. Parenting is demanding. Achieving success is demanding.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Having big life goals that you’re aiming to
        reach can be stressful. Our lives are far from perfect—maybe if I hadn’t had my first baby while
        starting my first tenure-track job and opening my first research lab, my teeth wouldn’t have gone numb!
        But I wanted to be a mother, </span><span class="calibre4">and</span><span> a professor, </span><span
        class="calibre4">and</span><span> a scientist. They all needed to happen on a certain nonnegotiable
        schedule (according to the laws of biology and the challenging academic career path), and I wasn’t
        willing to give any of them up.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>It’s a classic Catch-22: You’re in a long-term
        period of high demand, which means you need to be functioning at a high level. And the </span><span

        are being rapidly depleted by that very period of high demand you’re in.</span></p>

    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Remember that attention doesn’t </span><span

        able to navigate toward your big life goals, whatever they are—they might be pretty far off, but you
        need to start closing the gap if you’re going to get there, and attention issues are going to either
        send you in the wrong direction or leave you drifting. And we’re talking about your ability to respond
        well during a critical moment, whether in a life-threatening emergency or in an emotional or

    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>And in the brain, such moments signal that

    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>These conflict states signal that there is a
        problem. Attention is summoned to solve it. Yet the problems in our lives aren’t like math problems that
        can be solved and then checked off our to-do list. These are, more often than not, long-term, complex
        problems—or simply threads in the texture of being human—and can’t be efficiently “figured out” in that
        way.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The reason that conflict states are
        attention-draining: </span><span class="calibre4">they keep summoning attention over and over
        again.</span><span> This </span><span class="calibre4">continuous engagement</span><span> of attention
        depletes it. And as your attention becomes depleted, you go on autopilot. Your mind gets easily
        “captured” and carried away by whatever is most salient.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>When you carry conflict states around with you
        they can occupy and compete for your mental workspace and attentional resources. You’re so busy carrying
        that load that very few attentional resources remain to overcome automatic tendencies. Any </span><span
        class="calibre4">salient</span><span> thing will grab you—and keep you longer. So, if you’ve had a long
        and demanding day—say, you’re stressed, anxious, or preoccupied—you’re more likely to go for the bright
        shiny thing. You’ll grab the cookies instead of the carrots. You’ll click the flashing ad. You’ll spend
        the money you meant to save. You’ll spend something even more precious—</span><span class="calibre4">your
        attention—</span><span>in places you never intended to.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>And in these situations, we tend to turn to a
        handful of common strategies to cope. They’re common and natural, thus we default to them often. The
        problem is, they don’t work.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>We’re Using Failed Strategies</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span class="calibre4">Think positive. Focus on the
        good. Do something relaxing. Set goals and visualize them. Suppress upsetting thoughts. Concentrate on
        something else.</span><span> We’ve all heard these types of advice for coping and focusing under stress.
        Some of them make up a big part of performance psychology and professional leadership training. We often
        default to these tactics when we find ourselves mind-wandering or caught in a loop of negative thinking.
        The problem? All these strategies actually require attentional resources to implement. They use up
        attention instead of strengthening it. As much as we’re told that we can and should “change our
        experience by changing our thoughts”—by putting on rosier glasses—this strategy, like others, exacts a
        very high toll. And worse: under high stress, it usually doesn’t work.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Try this: </span><a
        name="epubbookmark72"></a><span>don’t think about a polar bear. I mean it! Don’t. It’s your one job

    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I have one guess.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We did a study with active-duty soldiers whom
        we tested to see if positivity training could help them over a high-demand period of military training.
        It didn’t. And not only did it not work to improve or protect attention, attention actually got worse
        over time.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Why? Part of the reason is that it takes a lot
        of attention to positively reframe an experience when undergoing distressing or demanding circumstances.
        When attention is already beginning to degrade, it’s hard to build this mental model, and the whole
        thing crumbles like a sandcastle at high tide. You then pour a lot of your cognitive resources into
        rebuilding and repairing it—which is like trying to keep your sandcastle from being washed away. You
        can’t. You end up mentally (and attentionally) exhausted, without anything to show for it.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>While there is substantial research that
        positivity is beneficial under many circumstances, tactics like positivity or suppression are not merely
        ineffective during periods of high stress and high demand—they can be actively damaging. I call these
        “failed strategies” because while we try to use them to solve our attention problems, what they do is
        degrade attention even further. (Imagine having a sprained ankle and trying to run on it.) It’s cyclical
        and exponential: as our focus fades and distractions intrude, we try to look on the bright side,
        suppress, escape, push away, barrel through. This effort sucks up cognitive resources. Stress goes up,
        mood worsens. The attention-degrading forces intensify. As attention degrades further and faster, you
        lean into these ineffective strategies harder, burning even more cognitive fuel. You’re in a downward
        spiral, cognitively depleted and less able to cope and function.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>You simply can’t </span><span
        class="calibre4">not</span><span> think about that polar bear, and trying not to drains you—</span><span
        class="calibre4">fast</span><span>. These strategies drive up attentional engagement. Using them is like
        trying to put out a fire with gasoline—it just makes things worse. In our struggle to control our
        attention, we’re pouring all our cognitive efforts into methods that simply do not work.</span></p>

        of struggling with my own attention—he had this toy he loved. Called “the water wiggler,” it was
        basically a clear plastic, slippery tube filled with water and sealed at both ends. When you tried to
        pick it up and grasp it, it doubled in on itself and shot out of your grip. It was impossible to hang
        onto. Leo would wrap his tiny hands around it, and it would pop into the air and go bouncing across the
        floor—endless entertainment.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Meanwhile, I was having no fun at all. I was
        locked into the same kind of cycle, but instead of a water wiggler, it was my attention I was trying to
        hang onto. Yet the tighter I grabbed, the more it shot away.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I remember </span><span
        class="calibre4">commanding</span><span> my mind to calm down and be still. I remember trying harder and
        harder to control it. It royally backfired. The distressing and distracting inner monologue just got
        louder. I felt hopeless—it seemed like the harder I tried, the worse it got. And the hopelessness was
        compounded by a growing sense of longing. I longed to really experience my life—not live in fast-forward
        or reverse.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Many of us experience this existential
        longing. Some event—a health scare, a divorce, a tragedy or loss, a global pandemic—prompts us to take
        stock of how present (or not) we are to the unfolding of our lives. The trigger might even be a good
        thing: a success, a promotion, a sweet moment with a loved one. Or it might be a gradual realization—a
        hunch you have that there </span><span class="calibre4">must</span><span> be some way to “up-level” your
        performance and well-being. Whatever it is, something clues you in that you are more distracted,
        dysregulated, and disconnected than you’d like to be—than you </span><span class="calibre4">need</span><span> to
        be to live your life to its peak. We’ve tried all the available
        tricks and tactics, from digital detox weekends to hack-your-life apps. We need a real solution to this
        predicament—something we can do to become more focused, less reactive, and more connected.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We understand now that our attention is
        powerful but vulnerable—that we are built for distraction, and that the world around us will
        relentlessly exploit that. I’ve also told you that there’s something you can do about this. But one
        challenge is that there’s a widespread belief that the brain doesn’t change that much. People often
        believe that they are “wired” one way or another, and that this wiring is relatively permanent, part of
        their genetic makeup or personality.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>Neuroplasticity: Train Your Brain to Change Your
        Brain</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Neuroscientists used to think the brain’s
        wiring was relatively permanent. We thought that by the time you reached adulthood—after you passed out
        of those malleable, formative teenage years—“the brain you had was the brain you had.” Sure, new
        connections could be made when you learned something or had a new experience, but that was simply making
        connections between existing landmarks—like putting a bridge up to connect two landmasses or adding an
        access road to connect two highways. You were still working with the same basic terrain. By adulthood,
        the map was already drawn in semipermanent ink.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Until we realized, as often happens in
        science, that we were wrong. The human brain—the fully developed brain, the adult brain, even the
      </span><span class="calibre4">injured</span><span> brain—has incredible </span><span
        class="calibre4">neuroplasticity,</span><span> meaning that it can reform or reorganize itself,
        depending on the input it receives and the processes it engages in with regularity. Here’s a quick
        example: In London, an old city with a complex, mind-boggling urban map, </span><a
        name="epubbookmark74"></a><span>researchers ran a study comparing the brains of bus drivers with those
        of cab drivers. They found that the hippocampus, a key part of the brain for memory and spatial
        navigation, was significantly bigger in the cab drivers than in the bus drivers. They mostly had the
        same job—driving through the city—so why? Because while the bus drivers only had to memorize and use one
        specific route, the cab drivers had to hold the entirety of the cityscape in their minds, flexibly
        scrolling through the mental map to find each new route. These people, obviously, hadn’t been driving
        buses and cabs since they were little kids—these changes to their brains had happened relatively
        recently.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>This research on neuroplasticity has been out
        there for years. But it hasn’t quite trickled out into the general consciousness. We still think of our
        brains as “hardwired”; we still believe that how we respond to situations—whether cognitively or
        emotionally—is an immutable fact, a facet of our personality or identity, something we have to deal with
        or work around but can’t actually change. That it even occurred to me during my “attentional” crisis
        that I could change my brain instead of my entire life is a consequence of my particular choice of
        career. When you’re faced with a crisis like the one I was in, the natural approach might be to figure
        out how to change your life so you can cope better—switch jobs, drop responsibilities, and so on. Yet to
        me, nothing was particularly negotiable. I was already on the right path, doing what I loved. There
        wasn’t anything I was wanting to change—except for the way I was feeling in the midst of it all. And as
        a neuroscientist, I already had an intimate knowledge of the brain’s incredible neuroplasticity. Brain
        injuries like those suffered by Gordon, the paraplegic I met all those years ago as a hospital
        volunteer, gave me my first inkling of what might be possible when it comes to neuroplasticity. After
        damage, the brain could dramatically recover some of the functions that it had seemingly lost. It would
        take time, practice, and persistence, but it was possible. This told me that the brain </span><span
        class="calibre4">could</span><span> change. So the next step, after going from injury to recovery, was
        to take people who are already healthy and provide them with opportunities for repeated practice. The
        hope was that with repetition they could </span><span class="calibre4">optimize</span><span> some of
        their functions. Could we use the brain’s capacity for neuroplasticity to make the mind healthier,
      </span><span class="calibre4">more</span><span> tailored to the challenges of our times?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I </span><span class="calibre4">could</span><span>
        change my brain—that much I was certain of. What I didn’t know,
        exactly, was </span><span class="calibre4">how.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>That same spring when my teeth went numb, the
        eminent neuroscientist Richard (Richie) Davidson happened to come to campus to give a lecture in my
        department. Today, Richie heads up a thriving center focused on meditation research at the University of
        Wisconsin–Madison, the Center for Healthy Minds, but when he came to Penn in the early 2000s he hadn’t
        started speaking at length about his recent research into meditation. Toward the end of his lecture, he
        put up two separate fMRI brain images on the screen side by side: one of a person induced to be in a
        positive mood, and one of a person induced to be in a negative mood. To get these images, researchers
        triggered emotional responses in participants by having them vividly recall happy or sad memories,
        playing upbeat or mournful music, or having them watch movie clips of contrasting mood. Meanwhile, the
        giant MRI magnet, buzzing and beeping with its radio frequency pulses, captured the brain activation
        data.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>MRI (magnetic resonance imaging), like the
        kind you might get for a knee or ankle injury, offers a </span><span class="calibre4">static</span><span> look
        at anatomy—a snapshot of what’s inside. An fMRI, or
      </span><span class="calibre4">functional</span><span> MRI, is different. It capitalizes on handy properties
        of the brain and of blood in a magnetic environment. When neurons fire, they require more oxygenated
        blood—and blood has a different magnetic signature when it’s rich with oxygen versus when it is not.
      </span><a name="epubbookmark75"></a><span>fMRI illuminates the ongoing levels of oxygenated blood in
        different parts of the brain over time, which means it can indirectly track, moment by moment, where in
        the brain neurons are most active. The images in the two slides that Richie showed us had strikingly
        different activity patterns, like Rorschach tests with opposite inkblots. The negative brain functioned
        differently from the positive one.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>During the Q&amp;A, I raised my hand. “How do
        you get the negative brain to look like the positive one?”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>He answered without hesitation.
        “Meditation.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I couldn’t believe he’d used that word. This
        was a brain science lecture—how could he bring up </span><span class="calibre4">meditation?</span><span>
        It seemed as outlandish as mentioning </span><span class="calibre4">astrology</span><span> to an
        audience of astrophysicists. Meditation was not a topic worthy of scientific pursuit! Nobody would take
        you seriously. Plus, I had my own personal reasons for being skeptical.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Growing up, my dad was committed to meditation
        practice. I remember stumbling into my parents’ bedroom early in the morning, bleary-eyed, to see my dad
        showered and dressed—</span><span class="calibre4">mala</span><span> (prayer beads) in hand, eyes
        closed, still as a statue. Although I didn’t often travel back to the Indian city where I’d been born,
        when I was about ten, we traveled to India for the summer. One of the big events for my family that year
        was a Hindu rite-of-passage ceremony for a cousin, a boy who was the same age as me. During the
        ceremony, the priest whispered something in his ear. I later discovered that what he’d whispered was a
        special </span><span class="calibre4">mantra</span><span>, a short passage in the ancient language of
        Sanskrit. He was to use prayer beads with 108 beads and silently, deliberately repeat the mantra 108
        times as a daily practice.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I was intrigued—it seemed like being invited
        into a secret club, very important and adult. I asked my mom what the mantra was, and when I might
        receive mine. That’s when she broke the news to me: I wouldn’t receive the mantra given to all
        boys</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span class="calibre4">.</span><span class="calibre4">&#xa0;</span><span
        class="calibre4">.</span><span class="calibre4">&#xa0;</span><span class="calibre4">.</span><span>
        because I was a girl. In the Hindu tradition, only boys got to have this ceremony, and only boys
        received the mantra. This gave my mom no pleasure, since she always wanted her daughters to be treated
        equally, but this was the cultural reality.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>That was it for me. I was done with
        meditation. If meditation wouldn’t accept me, I wouldn’t accept it. I lumped it all together and packed
        it away, boxing it up in my mind in the same container as the other outdated attitudes about gender
        roles, as well as all the other old traditions I chafed against. I was not going to learn to cook Indian
        food to be the perfect Indian wife, and I was certainly not going to meditate. So, when Richie Davidson
        said the word </span><span class="calibre4">meditation</span><span> in that seminar, every part of
        me—the scientist, the professor, the outraged young girl getting shut out of a family tradition—pushed
        back in opposition. I brushed his comment away, but it nagged at me.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Meanwhile, in the lab, we were looking for new
        routes for improving attention, mood, and performance. We tried many things—devices, brain-training
        games, and other strategies like mood inductions. In one study, we investigated a new device that many
        students called their “secret to academic success” because it made them feel more attentive</span><span
        class="calibre4">.</span><span> It was a small, handheld gadget that connected to earbuds and goggles.
        Users turned it on to experience blinking lights and soothing sounds. You didn’t have to </span><span
        class="calibre4">do</span><span> anything—you passively listened to the sounds and watched the lights.
        It was wildly popular—in one tech-happy Asian country, people were buying it for their children, and
        college students said it was single-handedly responsible for helping them pass the national exams. The
        manufacturer claimed that it would increase focus, improve memory, and reduce stress. So, did it,
        really?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>People who tried it said it did. But we didn’t
        have to take their word for it—my team and I could test it in the lab and find out definitively.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We ran one basic attention study, then another
        just to be sure. In both, we gave participants computer tests that evaluated their attention, then sent
        them home with these devices and instructions to use them for thirty minutes per day for two weeks. When
        we brought the participants back in to retest, here’s how much of an impact the device had had on their
        attentional performance: </span><span class="calibre4">zero.</span><span> There was no change, not even
        a hint of a directional trend.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The results from our other attempts weren’t
        convincing either. Back in the early 2000s, it seemed that most brain-training games didn’t work. By
        “didn’t work,” what I mean is that there was </span><a name="epubbookmark76"></a><span>no solid
        scientific consensus that playing most of these kinds of games leads to any benefits beyond simply
        getting better at that particular game. Sure, you might get a higher score on the game after playing it
        for two weeks—but you won’t perform better on a </span><span class="calibre4">new</span><span> game that
        also requires attention to excel. Any benefits were fleeting or constrained to only the specific game
        environment—they did not transfer or last. The reason? Well, the science on brain-training apps, and
        even on passive sensory devices, is steadily proliferating and the topic is still hotly debated. But my
        strong hunch is that they ask you to deploy attention in specific ways, and don’t train a very important
        aspect of attention, which is the </span><span class="calibre4">awareness</span><span> of where your
        attention is, moment to moment.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We tried a lot of the new stuff. Maybe it was

    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>A short time after Richie Davidson’s talk, I
        bought a book called </span><span class="calibre4">Meditation for Beginners</span><span>, by Jack
        Kornfield, a longtime teacher and author of mindfulness books, which came with a CD of guided meditation
        practices. The first time I played it, I didn’t expect much—I’d never done any kind of guided program
        before and didn’t think it would really be my thing. But it wasn’t at all what I thought meditation
        would be. I liked Kornfield’s voice and style, as well as his running commentary directing me to pay
        attention to my breath and notice my mind-wandering. There were no special mantras, no chanting, no
        instructions to contort my body or visualize energy, as I’d feared and expected. And the striking thing
        was that he seemed to know my mind! He predicted that it would wander, resist, push away, criticize, and
        get bored. He advised that, when you notice the mind “doing what minds do, simply return your attention
        back to the breath.” It wasn’t overly earnest or spiritual; quite the opposite. It was ordinary,
        down-to-earth, matter-of-fact.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“Meditation” is a broad category of human
        activity. It’s a general term, like “sports.” If someone asked whether you have any hobbies, you
        wouldn’t simply say, “I play sports.” You’d tell them you play tennis, or basketball, or ultimate
        frisbee. Sure, they all require general physical fitness, but there are sport-specific physical skills
        and aptitude you’d also need to develop for the particular sport you play. And the training drills
        differ for gymnastics as opposed to, say, hockey. Meditation is similar. It involves engaging in a
        particular set of practices to cultivate specific mental qualities. There are many forms of meditation
        that have been offered up across human history from the world’s wisdom traditions: philosophical,
        religious, and spiritual. The suite of practices—the mind’s “workout”—differs based on the particular
        type of meditation you do—be it transcendental, compassion, mindfulness meditation, or something else.
        With transcendental meditation, for example, you aim to achieve a “transcendent” state, connecting with
        something larger than yourself, while compassion meditation is about cultivating concern for the
        suffering of others and acting on behalf of reducing this suffering. The Kornfield book I read focused
        on </span><span class="calibre4">mindfulness meditation</span><span>—anchoring your attention in the
        present moment and experiencing it without “editorializing”: making up a story about what’s happening or
        will happen.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Over the next month, I practiced daily, adding
        a couple of minutes each week, eventually working up to a twenty-minute practice every day. And I began
        to feel the slow return of sensation to my mouth. My jaw stopped aching all the time. I could feel my
        teeth again. I could talk with ease! It gave me enormous relief. And then I noticed that I could see my
        husband’s face again. I mean </span><span class="calibre4">really</span><span> see it—notice his
        expressions, key in fast to what he was feeling or trying to communicate. It happened with my son, too.
        I felt so much more connected to both of them, almost effortlessly. And at work, I was feeling more
        present, more effective. I had a sense of being highly aware and anchored in my body, in my
        life</span><span class="calibre4">. Where had I been?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Nothing else in my life had changed—I still
        had the same demanding job, the same grants to write and classes to teach, students to mentor, lab to
        run and colleagues to debate, the same nightly bedtime story to read to my son about the wumps (more
        like a cross between a camel and a donkey than a guinea pig, now that I was paying attention). But
        something </span><span class="calibre4">had</span><span> changed—I felt completely different. I had
        managed to close that gap, to move back into my body, into my mind, into my surroundings. I felt capable
        and in control, confident that I could face challenges and work to overcome them. I felt </span><span
        class="calibre4">powerfully alive.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>And I got curious about why this was
        happening. Through this meditation practice, I found myself feeling dramatically different after just a
        month or two. It seemed a little bit like I’d just miraculously landed into feeling better. Yet I knew
        it wasn’t a miracle. Something had happened to my attention system, and I needed to figure out what. I
        knew a lot about the brain science of attention, but I had not come across anything in the scientific
        literature on its link with mindfulness practice. I thought, </span><span class="calibre4">I need to
        take this to the lab</span><span>.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>Road Testing Mindfulness</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I knew that designing an actual scientific
        study would be quite a bit different from the small-yet-impactful experiment I had conducted on
        myself—committing to a daily mindfulness practice to “test” whether I could feel better, clearer,
        sharper. This study would have nothing to do with my personal feelings and everything to do with being
        rigorous in my methods to determine whether objective performance could improve in people I didn’t even
        know. When we do a scientific study of attention, we set out to test specific questions, which are bound
        by detailed parameters and controls. The first thing we would need to know before asking specific
        research questions was how much time a person would need to engage in mindfulness exercises in order for
        us to be able to track the impact with objective metrics. Hours? Days? Weeks?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The best way to start, I decided, was to go
        big.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The Shambhala Mountain Center, outside of
        Denver, Colorado, is surrounded by the silver and green of aspen and birch, the ice blue of the Western
        sky, and the sharp purple ridges of the Rocky Mountains. The place is a retreat in the true sense of the
        word—removed from the rest of the world, from the usual business of life, even from cell phone service.
        Most important, for our purposes, the center conducts a monthlong intensive meditation retreat in which
        participants engage in a variety of activities mindfully for </span><span class="calibre4">twelve
        hours</span><span> per day, with most of those hours spent in formal meditation. If we were going to see
        an impact on our laboratory metrics of attention from mindfulness practice, we’d see it here—or it
        probably didn’t exist.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Members of my research team flew to Denver
        with a suitcase full of laptops, each one loaded with the same kind of attention tests we used in the
        lab. At the retreat center, they set up a table at the check-in spot and, as people arrived, handed out
        flyers asking for volunteers. </span><span class="calibre4">“Participate in a study on attention and
        mindfulness meditation!”</span><span> the flyers said, and many people, most of whom had been meditators
        for years, perked up, intrigued. The next morning, before the retreat began, volunteers arrived in
        groups of five, sat down at the laptop stations, and were guided through a series of tasks designed to
        gather data and give us a baseline: What was their starting point? In terms of attentional
        functionality, what was their “normal”?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>One of these tests was called the Sustained
        Attention to Response Task, or SART. This test was developed in the late 1990s, and, as the name
        suggests, it tests a person’s ability to sustain attention. Here’s how it works: participants sit in
        front of a computer screen where a number appears for half a second, then vanishes; a half second later,
        another number appears, then vanishes; and so on for twenty minutes. Their job: Press the space bar
        every time a number appears—</span><span class="calibre4">unless</span><span> the number is 3. Then,
        don’t press. By design, the number 3 appears only 5 percent of the time—not a lot.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>This test engages all three of your
        attentional subsystems. You </span><span class="calibre4">orient</span><span> attention</span><span
        class="calibre4">,</span><span> focusing on each number as it flickers; stay </span><span
        class="calibre4">alert</span><span> to the appearance of the number 3; and use </span><span
        class="calibre4">executive attention</span><span> to make sure you’re following the instructions,
        pressing only when you should. Simple.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Simple, perhaps. But not easy. Most people are
        pretty terrible at this task. Why? Perhaps the numbers flicker by too quickly, making it difficult for
        them to actually see clearly? Nope. Half a second is plenty of time for the brain to process visual
        information. Maybe they look away from the screen? We checked. Tracking their eye movements by securing
        electrodes around their eyes, we learned that our participants were great at keeping their eyes on the
        screen. Here’s what else we learned: although their eyes were on the screen, their attention was not.
        They were on autopilot, pressing the space bar no matter what number appeared. Their attentional
        flashlight was directed elsewhere, the floodlight was offline, the juggler dropped the ball.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I chose the SART for this exact reason. Before
        asking fine-grained questions about </span><span class="calibre4">which</span><span> subsystems of
        attention are strengthened, I wanted to know if mindfulness training could minimize a fundamental
        vulnerability suffered by </span><span class="calibre4">all</span><span> subsystems—attentional
        hijacking. Could a monthlong retreat boost attention to help keep it on the task-at-hand? To find out, I
        needed a test that would engage attention broadly, and also challenge it with distraction, boredom, and
        mind-wandering. The SART was perfect.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>In follow-up tests, we’d ask more specific
        questions and isolate various subsystems of attention—to see if, for example, training improved the
        floodlight more so than the flashlight, which a later study confirmed.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Our study participants in the mountains of
        Colorado finished their initial tests and went off to spend the next four weeks immersed in mindfulness:
        living mindfully, and formally practicing mindfulness exercises for the majority of their waking hours
        each day. (I did a much shorter version of this type of retreat many months later, and the best way to
        describe it is “a bootcamp for the brain”—it was intense!) From the moment they woke early in the
        morning until they went to bed, they would practice—in silence—in thirty- to fifty-five-minute sessions.
        Even their meals were eaten in silence, and retreatants were given instruction on how to continue their
        practice while eating. At the end of that month, we’d be back to administer the SART again, and see what
        (if anything) had changed. It was a little bit like tagging fish and releasing them back into the
        ocean—off they swam with the rest of the group into the meditative waters of a retreat
        environment.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Meanwhile, we gave a group of nonmeditators
        the SART two times, a month apart as well. When we went back to Colorado a month later to catch those
        experienced meditators on their way out the door, what we found is that their attention had </span><span
        class="calibre4">improved.</span><span> They performed much better after the retreat. Before the
        retreat, participants were pressing that button when they shouldn’t, about 40 percent of the time—that
        was their starting point. The nonmeditators also made errors 40 percent of the time, and their scores
        did not change when we tested them again a month later. But </span><a name="epubbookmark77"></a><span>after the
        retreat, the meditators only mistakenly pressed the space bar
      </span><span class="calibre4">30</span><span> percent of the time. So, a 10 percent improvement
        overall.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>If 10 percent doesn’t sound like a lot—or if
        missing the number 3 doesn’t seem like a big deal—consider the parallel real-world scenarios. </span><a
        name="epubbookmark78"></a><span>A version of the SART was conducted with live-fire simulation. That
        means that instead of a number 3, a simulated human target would flash on the screen, and instead of
        pressing a space bar, the subject would fire a weapon with simulated ammunition. Participants’
        performance was not much different in the “live-fire” version of the SART, however. They were shooting
        when they shouldn’t have—</span><span class="calibre4">a lot</span><span>. I was struck by this, as it
        suggests that attention—and improving it—could have life and death consequences in the real
        world.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Encouraged, </span><a
        name="epubbookmark79"></a><span>we also conducted studies that let us dig into the subsystems of
        attention with mindfulness training. We used the attention network test to see how the flashlight, the
        floodlight, and the juggler responded to mindfulness. Here’s what we found: meditators had better
        jugglers; executive attention was better in retreat participants </span><span
        class="calibre4">before</span><span> they even started the retreat. After the retreat, they improved in
        alerting—their floodlights were fast to detect new information.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We also offered the same test to medical and
        nursing students on campus. We found that after they took an eight-week mindfulness-based stress
        reduction course, like those offered at over 750 medical centers worldwide, they improved in orienting.
        They had a better grip on their flashlight.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>In my own experience, in the very early days
        when I began mindfulness training, one of the first things I’d noticed was that I felt </span><span
        class="calibre4">worse.</span><span> I noticed the drop in my stomach—which, like the accompanying
        anxiety and sadness, would linger for hours—when I had to leave my son at day care and walk away; I
        noticed the dull ache in my clenched jaw, often synchronized with feeling overwhelmed by the parade of
        demands throughout my workday. My thoughts continued to whirl without stopping long after I got home
        from the lab. This stuff had always been there, of course, but now it seemed magnified </span><span
        class="calibre4">because I was paying attention to it.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>But then, because I was more aware of physical
        sensations and concurrent negative thoughts, I slowly began to catch the thought earlier. I could notice
        it, acknowledge it, and let it pass away on its own. This way of interacting with my mind gave me a
        stronger sense of control. Instead of feeling constantly hijacked and held hostage by distressing
        thoughts and emotions, I was aware of my body tightening and my attention drifting. Soon, I felt more
        capable of redirecting my mind if I chose to. I could step out of a loop of negative thinking, instead
        of getting caught in it, like in the churn at the bottom of a waterfall.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>And now, the data from these initial studies
        seemed to corroborate my experience, suggesting that mindfulness meditation, unlike </span><span
        class="calibre4">anything else we’d studied so far,</span><span> could actually change the way our
        attention, our “brain’s boss,” behaved. But we needed to make sure.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>Is Mindfulness Really the Secret Sauce?</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Four days a week for four weeks we </span><a
        name="epubbookmark80"></a><span>intercepted the University of Miami football team at the end of their
        weight-training workout. My lab assistants would hand out iPod Shuffles with headsets attached (it was
        back when iPod Shuffles were still a thing). A twelve-minute recording of the soothing yet confidently
        firm voice of my colleague Scott Rogers would guide players through one of two possible activities: a
        mindfulness exercise or a relaxation exercise. The players didn’t know it, but they’d been separated
        into two groups: one group was receiving mindfulness training, while the other was receiving relaxation
        training. The exercises that both groups (unbeknownst to them) were asked to do at the same time
      </span><span class="calibre4">appeared</span><span> similar enough to the casual onlooker (for example, they
        were simply lying on their mats on the floor with eyes closed). But in fact their attention was being
        “instructed” in quite different ways—the mindfulness group was guided through exercises that honed their
        attention to be in an observational stance, like breath awareness and body scans (practices I’ll lead
        you through soon), while the relaxation group instead used attention to manipulate thought and direct
        their muscle movements (as in progressive muscle relaxation exercises). And then, outside of the
        structured training sessions, we had all the participants download the same practice recordings onto
        their smartphones—instructing them to practice on their own on other days of the week we didn’t see
        them.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We didn’t have a no-training control group, as
        we typically would with a scientific study—everybody participated. The football players were in
        preseason training, a high-stress interval with high stakes: at the end of it, they’d all head to
        training camp, where their performance would determine the trajectory of their entire playing season,
        and maybe even their career. The head coach, cognizant that anyone who didn’t get training of some kind
        could be at a disadvantage, insisted that everybody get something. This made for a stronger test anyway,
        because it asked an urgent question: If mindfulness training is helpful, is it </span><span
        class="calibre4">more</span><span> helpful than doing something else, like relaxation training?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We knew that those experienced meditators on
        retreat in Colorado as well as the medical and nursing students we’d trained back on campus had improved
        measurably. What we needed to figure out now was whether </span><span class="calibre4">mindfulness</span><span>,
        in particular, was the key piece of the equation that was
        helping, or whether relaxation exercises would have the same effect.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We were prepared to see our participants’
        attention decline over the course of the preseason interval. This is </span><a
        name="epubbookmark81"></a><span>something we’d discovered about attention and high-demand periods:
      </span><span class="calibre4">everybody degrades.</span><span> Students, soldiers, elite athletes—everybody.
        So what we were asking was this: Could mindfulness training or relaxation help stave off that
        degradation of attention?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Here’s what we found: Both types of training
        helped in some areas, like emotional well-being. But then, for attention, the two groups diverged—and
        they diverged the most for those who engaged in the daily exercises five or more days per week.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>In the mindfulness group, attention skills
      </span><span class="calibre4">held steady</span><span> instead of degrading—mindfulness training had indeed
        worked to “protect” their attention, even through this high-demand period.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>But in the relaxation group, attention got
      </span><span class="calibre4">worse.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I’m absolutely not saying “don’t relax.” What
        I’m saying—and what the science is showing—is that trying to use relaxation as an antidote to
        attentional degradation </span><span class="calibre4">will not work</span><span>, because it doesn’t
        actually address the </span><span class="calibre4">reasons</span><span> that attention is
        degrading</span><span class="calibre4">.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>As we discussed earlier, some tactics, while
        beneficial in many circumstances, can actively make things worse if they are used during high-demand
        intervals when attention is in short supply. Remember “Don’t think about a polar bear”? The common
        advice we hear is </span><span class="calibre4">suppress—don’t think about it right now.</span><span>
        (Visualize something positive instead.) The new science of attention says no—instead, </span><span
        class="calibre4">accept and allow.</span><span> Trying to suppress has a paradoxical effect: it keeps
        the content in your working memory longer, because you have to actively remind yourself to keep
        suppressing. </span><a name="epubbookmark82"></a><span>Many studies on mindfulness practice suggest that
        if you </span><span class="calibre4">accept and allow</span><span> instead of </span><span
        class="calibre4">resist</span><span> (which we’ll be learning how to do in the coming chapters),
        stressful content will pass away.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We knew that mindfulness practice was the key
        to training attention. The next question was: </span><span class="calibre4">How</span><span> effective
        was it? Could it help us outside of a controlled university environment or a serene retreat locale?
        Could it help under extreme stress, under time pressure, under high demand? We’d tested mindfulness
        under ideal conditions—what about the opposite? In other words: </span><span class="calibre4">real
        life</span><span>?</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>Mindfulness Under Pressure</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>In the lab, when we started to consider how
        kryptonite conditions like stress impact attention, it seemed that there were many </span><span
        class="calibre4">different</span><span> ways. But one common factor was this: stress </span><span
        class="calibre4">hijacks your attention away from the present moment</span><span>.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Mental time travel takes us out of the current
        moment in time and, while doing so, monopolizes all our attention. The prevalence of attentional
        hijacking suggested to me that training the mind to stay in the present could be an important missing
        piece in </span><span class="calibre4">attention training</span><span>—a catalytic ingredient that the
        gadgets, brain-training apps, and other approaches we had tried were missing. To find out if I was on to
        something, we set our sights on one of the most high-stress, high-demand populations: the
        military.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I gripped my armrests as the plane circled
        above West Palm Beach, waiting to land. I was nervous, but it wasn’t fear of flying: I was there to meet
        the leadership of a Marine Reserve unit. My colleague and I were pitching a pilot study on mindfulness
        training specifically for the military and I had no idea if they would accept it. Our liaisons, two
        captains in the Marine Reserves who’d tentatively agreed to let us on base, had gone out on a limb in
        allowing us to come out to run a mindfulness meditation program with their Marines. These were warriors.
        Mindfulness meditation was not exactly their </span><span class="calibre4">thing.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The study at the retreat center in Colorado
        had yielded promising results. Those participants had </span><span class="calibre4">improved</span><span>,
        indicating that mindfulness could boost attention under ideal
        circumstances. But what about </span><span class="calibre4">less</span><span>-than-ideal circumstances?
        What about less than a full month of intensive, continuous meditation in a placid, remote place? Sounds
        great to be in an idyllic mountain retreat—but most of us need help with our attention while we’re in
        the midst of our day-to-day lives, under pressure, juggling a million things. And further, meditating
      </span><span class="calibre4">twelve hours a day</span><span> is hardly realistic for the vast majority of
        people. Could mindfulness help the rest of us?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We’d been mulling over these questions at the
        lab when I got a phone call from a security studies professor from another university. A veteran who had
        turned to mindfulness after experiencing firsthand the difficulties associated with deployment, she was
        interested in offering it to other military service members. Since she didn’t have a background in
        neuroscience or experimental research, she was looking for a research collaborator. Richie Davidson, who
        I had stayed in touch with since his lecture at Penn, suggested she try me.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I was intrigued and got to work poring over
        existing research on attention and military deployment. I was immediately engrossed and, frankly, quite
        concerned. The military represented a population that had to deal with extremely high-demand situations
        all the time, and it clearly took a toll. During predeployment, service members trained intensively,
        simulating scenarios in which lives were at stake all day, every day. Then they deployed into scenarios
        where lives were </span><span class="calibre4">actually</span><span> at stake. Those potent forces we’ve
        been discussing that degrade attention are a constant way of life for military service members. Add to
        that other factors that degrade attention, like sleep disturbances, uncertainty, extreme temperatures,
        and mortality salience (thinking about your own death). And to punch things up even further, this was in
        the post-9/11 era of the military surge in Iraq. The year was 2007 and, as a nation, the United States
        had been at war abroad for six years. Units were going out on back-to-back deployments. Rates of suicide
        and PTSD among service members were climbing. Not only was high stress causing warriors to spiral into
        psychological disorders, but many were suffering from moral injury, struggling with regret, remorse, and
        guilt when their own reactivity led to behavior that violated their ethical code.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Did I have any hesitations about working with
        the military? Sure. I thought long and hard about it. A lot of the problems that these warriors were
        suffering from stem from having to go to war. Wouldn’t it be better not to have war?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Well, of course—wouldn’t that be great? But
        that question is fundamentally similar to the questions of what the rest of us should do about stressors
        in our own lives: Should we change our lives, or our minds? I can’t personally change the world and end
        war. But maybe I could help those serving in the military function better through incredible stress,
        protect their attention from degrading, regulate their emotions more effectively, and hold their own
        ethical code at the forefront of their minds even through the fog of war.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>And finally, there was much to learn from this
        demographic. Could mindfulness help the attention of those under the most high-stress, high-pressure,
        and </span><span class="calibre4">time</span><span>-pressure situations imaginable? Could it give a
        boost to those who are compromised because of the job they have been asked to do, at the request of a
        nation? If so, it could probably help the rest of us, too. It was time to see if we could bring
        mindfulness down from the mountain and into the trenches.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>This Is Never Going to Work</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>That’s what then captain Jason Spitaletta said
        to me as we walked onto the Marine Corps Reserve Center in West Palm Beach, Florida. He sounded
        good-natured about it. He smiled when he shook my hand and cheerfully told me our study was probably
        doomed. Marines, he said, were just not going to go for it. </span><span
        class="calibre4">Mindfulness</span><span> wasn’t something they’d invest in—it was too “soft” sounding.
        (This was 2007—it was very new to everybody back then.)</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Nevertheless, Captain Spitaletta and his
        coleader on the reserve base had agreed to host the study. His coleader? Captain Jeff Davis, whom you
        might remember from </span><a href="#epubbookmark9" style="text-decoration:none"><span class="calibre1">chapter
          2</span></a><span>—this was my first time meeting with him, and I wasn’t
        sure what to expect. When we’d spoken to Davis on the phone a few months before, he’d seemed skeptical
        yet open, acknowledging that they needed to try something new.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Spitaletta and Davis appeared exactly the way
        I figured Marines would look: jarheads. I admit that I had a moment of cognitive dissonance. It was hard
        to picture these two—stoic, brawny guys in desert camo—sitting and meditating. And if even I had trouble
        picturing it, military leadership would likely have its own doubts. At this early point in our research,
        there was no precedent for mindfulness meditation as “cognitive training.” We were going to put this to
        the test and see what the data revealed. My main goal was to set the conditions for a strong experiment:
        asking the right questions and selecting evaluation metrics that would be sensitive enough to detect
        even small changes in attention. With thoughtful planning and luck on our side, we’d get a clear answer,
        one way or another.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I was fortunate to have Davis and Spitaletta
        as my collaborators. Although they were captains in the Marine Reserves, they could have been grad
        students in my lab. As we spoke, I found them whip-smart and curious, fascinated by neuroscience and
        experimental research. I could feel their compassionate leadership—that they truly cared and wanted to
        help their fellow Marines, who they were leading into difficult, complex, and dangerous situations.
        Davis, who had little kids at home, was about to go out on his fourth back-to-back deployment—talk about
        kryptonite!</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>It was true, what he’d said on the phone,
        about needing to try something new. We </span><span class="calibre4">all</span><span> needed to try
        something new.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>On campus, our lab experiments had simulated
        high-stress situations by flashing disturbing images while research volunteers were in the middle of
        attention tasks. But here, in the Marine Corps Reserve Center, we had access to people who would be
        experiencing not just images in a lab but potent real-life stressors. This was no serene retreat center.
        Would mindfulness make a difference </span><span class="calibre4">here</span><span>?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>My team and I set up our laptops and gave the
        Marines various cognitive tasks. We also probed their mood and stress levels. And then, for the eight
        weeks of predeployment training that followed, they were offered a twenty-four-hour program modeled off
        of the well-established, mindfulness-based stress reduction techniques that had been tested in medical
        settings, but contextualized for a military cohort. They were introduced to a foundational set of
        practices: attention to the breath, scanning the body, and so on—practices that entail bringing
        attention into the present moment, in a “non-editorializing” way. We knew we needed to deliver these
        practices in a way that would make sense to this demographic so that it would be accessible to
        them.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Their homework: thirty minutes of mindfulness
        practice every day.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Eight weeks later, we were back to test them
        again. Some had done the assigned thirty minutes daily on several days, but most did far less. They were
        all over the place. This was what data from the field can often look like: lots of variability across
        participants. It was quite a departure from the post-retreat meditators. To plot the results, we split
        the group in two. The “high-practice” group averaged about twelve minutes a day, while the
        “low-practice” group was made up of the participants who’d done significantly less. Here’s what we saw:
        while the low-practice group got progressively worse in terms of attention, working memory, and mood
        over the eight weeks, the high-practice group remained stable. At the end of the training interval, the
        high-practice group performed better and reported feeling better than the low-practice group and a
        no-training control group. What we’d found in our earlier studies was holding true, even under higher
        demand: </span><span class="calibre4">mindfulness could indeed stabilize attention.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>After this phase of our study, the Marines
        were deployed. When they came back, we retested them. And again, the results were initially a mixed
        bag—nothing was reaching statistical significance. The group was small; some members had dropped out of
        the study, left the military, or moved on to a new post. Many had stopped doing the training practices
        during deployment.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Still, one pattern stood out. When we looked
        at those who had been in our low-practice group at predeployment, a subset of participants actually
        performed </span><span class="calibre4">better</span><span> than before they left. This result
        contradicted the earlier data and made no sense—why were they performing so well? After all, even before
        they were deployed, they’d done minimal practice compared to the others.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I called my colleague who had developed and
        delivered the training to try to get to the bottom of it. She didn’t have an explanation either—until I
        read her the names of the participants in the low-practice group. That jogged her memory. It turned out
        they had emailed her from Iraq and said things like, “My buddy who did your program before we were
        deployed is sleeping through the night. I need you to help me learn to do what he’s doing.” From a
        distance, they were able to begin engaging in the mindfulness practices with the trainer’s
        guidance.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Basically, this low-practice group had turned
        themselves into a </span><span class="calibre4">high-</span><span>practice group on their own.
        Mid-deployment in Iraq, with what I can only imagine were unpredictable schedules and very demanding
        circumstances, they’d taken it upon themselves to do </span><span class="calibre4">more</span><span>
        mindfulness practice, because it was blatantly apparent to them what a difference it made.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Now, it’s important to note that this
        study—our first trial run of delivering mindfulness training in a military setting—was promising. Still,
        it didn’t produce stunning results—it was small, and the data were variable. But even though the results
        were modest, the implications were </span><span class="calibre4">huge.</span><span> First:
        mindfulness-based training could be introduced to high-demand groups to protect attention. And second:
        it wasn’t a situation where you could say “any exposure to training is helpful.” It required regular
        practice to benefit.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>All the hoops we’d jumped through to get the
        study off the ground had been worth it. We had right in front of us living, breathing proof that
        mindfulness training created a kind of “mental armor” that could effectively protect individuals’
        attentional resources, even in the most high-stress scenarios imaginable.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>Time to Start Training</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Imagine a moment that calls for physical
        strength. Say you’re about to help a friend move a piece of furniture. You approach the heavy couch,
        realize you’re not quite up to the task
        and</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.
        drop to the floor and begin to do push-ups in an effort to gain the strength you need.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>If that sounds silly, consider that this is
        what so many of us do every day, constantly, when faced with cognitive challenges—instead of developing
        a training regimen, making it a habit, and doing a little bit each day to build up our capacities, we
        drop and try to eke out a “mental push-up” or two once we’re under stress or in crisis, the whole time
        believing that it will help and that we’ll be able to stand up and “lift that couch.” Instead, we’ll
        only be more depleted.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We need to start training </span><span
        class="calibre4">now,</span><span> both for the period of high demand we may be in currently, and for
        periods of demand we’ll face in the future.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The good news is that you can start small. And
        you can start immediately. In fact, </span><span class="calibre4">you already have.</span><span> At this
        point, you’re well on your way along your attention-training journey. You know your own strength (the
        power of attention). And you know your enemy (the chief forms of kryptonite, like stress, poor mood, and
        threat, and why they are so damaging). What we’re going to talk about next are the ways in which our
        brains are built to wander, and why, and what we can do about it. It turns out that our attentional
        problems can’t be pinned entirely on external types of stressors, like the ones we’ve discussed here.
        It’s tempting to think of difficult circumstances as the main challenge—we think, </span><span
        class="calibre4">if we could just eliminate them, we’d be fine</span><span>.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>But ultimately, factors that degrade attention
        are weeds on the </span><span class="calibre4">inner landscape</span><span>, or what I sometimes call
        the “mindscape”: they have less to do with external forces working against you, and more to do with how
        attention works. If you whack these weeds down (by getting rid of stressors and “threats”), they’ll just
        pop back up. Maybe you don’t have any weeds creeping onto your mindscape during that weekend spa retreat
        or deep-sea fishing trip, but that doesn’t mean they won’t reappear as soon as you get back to regular
        life. In fact, your wish to return to your blissful vacation can be a weed itself, making your Monday a
        new type of miserable.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Through my crisis of attention, I discovered
        that I didn’t know my own mindscape, really. Sure, I “knew myself” in the Socratic sense: my character,
        values, and preferences. But I didn’t know, nor did I value knowing, what was happening in my mind
        moment by moment. Where was my attention in this moment? What thoughts, emotions, or memories were
        (pre)occupying me right now? What stories, assumptions, and mindsets were at play?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>As someone who had always thought of myself as
        an action-oriented, results-focused, competitive go-getter with high ambitions and a driven edge, what I
        learned when I embarked on my mindfulness journey surprised me. For the first time, I experienced a way
        of engaging with my mind, and learning about my mindscape, that was not about striving harder, thinking
        better and faster, and </span><span class="calibre4">doing</span><span> more. It was about </span><span
        class="calibre4">being</span><span>—being receptive, being curious, being present for the moments of my
        life. Before, I’d always assumed I could “think” my way out of any difficult problem I was facing. My
        guess is that most of us believe this—that the only and best way to learn something, assess a situation,
        or manage a crisis is to think it through, puzzle it out, problem-solve with logic, and then do
        something about it. Psychologists call this “discursive thinking”: judging, planning, strategizing, and
        so on. We don’t know of any other way to operate. But thinking and doing, as it turns out, are simply
        not enough.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The science of attention emphasizes
      </span><span class="calibre4">action.</span><span> This stems from our understanding of why we evolved to
        have an attention system in the first place—to </span><span class="calibre4">constrain</span><span> our
        information processing and filter out irrelevant clutter so we can focus on a task and accomplish
        important goals. In other words, we need attention so we can act and interact with the world. This
        narrow emphasis in the literature is also why I came up empty-handed when I sought answers for my
        attention crisis. While it frustrated me at first, it also motivated me to investigate a different
        attentional mode, one that is receptive and entails </span><span class="calibre4">noticing,
        observing,</span><span> and </span><span class="calibre4">being</span><span>.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>While Descartes resolved his existential angst
        by concluding “I think, therefore I am,” most of us feel more angst </span><span
        class="calibre4">because</span><span> of our thinking: “I think, therefore I am—distracted.” We are
        collectively and chronically addicted to thinking and doing, which is why shifting into a being mode
        does not come easily to most of us. It requires training. And a growing literature on the new science of
        attention suggests that with this training our thinking and doing become more effective and
        meaningful.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>A peak mind is a mind that doesn’t privilege
        thinking and doing over being. It masters both modes of attention. It is focused and receptive, and with
        this balance we can overcome and rise above our attentional challenges. This is how we win the unfair
        fight.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Captain Davis—whom we met in the middle of his
        own attentional crisis on that bridge in Florida—had another crisis recently, of a very different
        type.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>At the age of forty-four, he had a heart
        attack while riding in an Uber. When he told me about it, he described drawing on the mindfulness
        training he’d started during our study, more than a decade ago now. Instead of panicking, he quickly
        observed and assessed the situation before launching into action—seeing himself as a man in a car in
        need of immediate medical care. He was focused and calm, directing the Uber driver to pull over. He
        called 911 himself, and even flagged down the ambulance as he saw it approaching. In fact, he seemed so
        unlike a man experiencing a life-threatening health crisis that the ambulance driver tried to brush him
        off, saying, “No, no, I’m here for a man having a heart attack!” Even though his body was in crisis, his
        attention was both receptive and focused. He was still able to access his peak mind.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>When Captain Davis told me about the heart
        attack, I was so relieved to hear that he was all right. I also marveled at how he’d transformed his own
        attention. Here was a guy who went from having a really terrible “boss”—an attention system that almost
        drove him off a bridge—to having one that was an exquisite leader, guide, and ally: one that saved his
        life.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>At this point, if you’re ready to improve your

    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>On a recent trip to California, I flew into San
        Jose and drove a rental car south. The bright blue sky had a freshness that cleared away my jet lag.
        There was barely any traffic—the highway was four lanes, wide open, and my attention widened, too. I
        cruised along, having all kinds of
        thoughts.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.
        I mentally worked on a paper I was writing, puzzled over an idea for a new experiment, made a mental
        checklist of the questions I needed to ask my kids when I called them in the evening. As I glimpsed the
        tall evergreen trees peeking above the concrete sound barriers, so different from the landscape at home
        in Miami, I sang along to my playlist. My mind shifted rapidly between these various currents of thought
        like a fish in a slipstream, from one to the next and then back, and that was fine—until I merged onto
        Highway 17, a narrow, curving, often dangerous road that winds through the foothills leading down to
        Santa Cruz on the Pacific Ocean. All of a sudden, it seemed, a veil of clouds slid over the sky. A fog
        surrounded my car; the rain started pouring and the asphalt got slick; the traffic thickened. The road
        pinched down to two lanes and a driver cut in front of me; at one point, a mudslide edged into the road.
        My thoughts narrowed with the road, down to a single intense point: </span><span class="calibre4">Get to
        where you’re going alive!</span><span> But worry set in, and then, worry about being worried. I knew
        this would not serve me. I needed to funnel all my cognitive energy into navigating the road ahead. I
        had to </span><span class="calibre4">focus.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Obviously, I made it past the mudslides and
        the daredevil drivers of Highway 17, or I wouldn’t be reporting back to you now. The point of this story
        is that sometimes you need to be able to grab the flashlight of your attention, aim it, and hold it
        where you need it. Other times, your focus can meander, flitting about, occasionally taking hold of
        something in the landscape or your mindscape. Either way, your flashlight is affected, and that’s
        something that most of us don’t have much awareness of, or ability to
        control</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.
        just yet.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Your flashlight represents your </span><span
        class="calibre4">capacity to select a subset of information</span><span> from all that is out
        there</span><span class="calibre4">.</span><span> When I say </span><span class="calibre4">focus,</span><span>
        this is what I mean—that the information you’ve selected, whatever
        it may be, is being processed better and is of higher quality than everything else around it. Remember
        that “war” inside your brain: when attention is directed toward something, be it a place, person, or
        object, the neurons coding it temporarily win influence over the brain’s activity. Focusing on something
        dials up its “brightness” while dimming down information that is irrelevant for our current goals.
        Without this capacity, we would often be frozen, confused, and overwhelmed.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We rarely notice the way our attention
        shape-shifts, from narrow to broad, depending on circumstances and the demands of the environment. But
        I’m betting you </span><span class="calibre4">do</span><span> notice when your flashlight isn’t where
        you want it—the times when you need to focus on something important, yet struggle to stay on-task. It
        may be other thoughts, strong emotions, or personal preoccupations that are pulling you away. In an
        ironic twist, the pressure and stress of having to focus on a task or demand may be the very cause of
        your distractibility. And when this happens, you may attempt to soothe or distract yourself in
        unproductive ways, leading to mindless mental scrolling and clicking, so to speak, that move you even
        further away from accomplishing your task. If you’ve had to fight your way back to focus, you are not
        alone. </span><a name="epubbookmark84"></a><span>A recent survey of social media use in the workplace
        reported that while it can help provide a “mental break,” 56 percent of employees said it distracts them
        from the work they need to do.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>What we </span><span
        class="calibre4">are</span><span> aware of is that we’re struggling to keep our thoughts from straying
        from the task-at-hand. How many times in a day do you look up, realizing that your mind is anywhere but
        on the work right in front of you? It can be incredibly frustrating—you </span><span
        class="calibre4">know</span><span> that there are real consequences for losing focus (a missed deadline,
        a car approaching that you don’t notice, or something worse), and yet you simply can’t seem to keep it
        where you need it.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>How Steady Is Your Flashlight?</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><a name="epubbookmark85"></a><span>We conducted a
        study with undergraduate students at the University of Miami where we asked them to come into the lab,
        sit at one of our computers, and silently read chapters from a psychology textbook, presented one
        sentence at a time on the screen. Most of the text flowed normally. But then we’d throw in a completely
        out-of-context sentence. We did this infrequently—only about 5 percent of the time—but if you were
        paying attention, it’d be obvious that the sentence was out of place. The participants’ job was simple:
        after each sentence, press the space bar to advance to the next sentence, or, if a sentence was out of
        context for the paragraph, tell us by pressing the shift key instead. I love eating tangerines. If you
        were in our lab for this experiment, you’d have pressed the shift key when you read that last
        sentence.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We encouraged them to pay close attention and
        gave them a clear incentive: there would be a quiz at the end, and they were receiving course credit for
        their time.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>How did they do? Not well at all. They missed
        the out-of-context sentences most of the time. And naturally, the more sentences they missed, the worse
        they did on the quiz that came after—they were clearly not retaining the material.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>You might protest that the experiment is too
        tough—textbooks can be so dry and dense, you say, and pressing a space bar often over twenty minutes
        sounds pretty darn boring. Perhaps. </span><span class="calibre4">But.</span><span> </span><a
        name="epubbookmark86"></a><span>Other experiments have found the same thing with easier parameters: Read
        the text that appears on the screen, and if it’s an actual word, press the space bar. If it’s not, press
        the shift key. When participants read word after word, pressing the space bar ovet arp thj usult grept
        frew bramt. I have to ask—how many words did you read before you noticed that they weren’t, well,
        words?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>In the study, now repeated by many labs,
      </span><a name="epubbookmark87"></a><span>people fail to immediately notice that the words are meaningless
        30 percent of the time, and continue pressing the space bar an average of </span><span
        class="calibre4">seventeen times</span><span> before they realize the text they’re reading is actually
        gibberish.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Maybe that wasn’t fair—I didn’t warn you it
        was coming! Let’s try another exercise, with all the rules on the table. This one’s very simple, and it
        won’t take more than a few seconds. You don’t even need to move from where you’re sitting.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>When I say “Go,” I want you to close your eyes
        and take five breaths. If you already have a meditation practice, make it fifteen. Regular, even
        breaths. Your job is to focus on your breath—in, and then out—and </span><span
        class="calibre4">only</span><span> on your breath. As soon as you notice your thoughts moving to
        something else, or an intrusive thought popping in, stop and open your eyes.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Ready? </span><span class="calibre4">Go.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>All right, let’s assess. How many breaths did
        you make it through before you experienced a distraction and stopped? I’m guessing not five. Not even
        close.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Admittedly, this was just a quick,
        low-pressure, on-the-page game—there weren’t any stakes here. Perhaps if there were real consequences,
        you’d have been able to hold your focus on your breath (or any target) a bit longer. But what we’ve
        found in the lab, as well as in the field of attention research, is that it’s the same when the stakes
      </span><span class="calibre4">are</span><span> high. </span><a name="epubbookmark88"></a><span>People cannot
        hold their focus, no matter what. Not if they are paid. Not if their task is solely to enjoy an
        activity. Not even if the consequences for losing focus are disastrous.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>The Neurosurgeon and the Mechanic</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I got out of the cab on a cold, gray winter
        morning, coffee cup in hand, and headed into the looming hospital building on the campus of a major
        academic medical center. It was 6:30 a.m.—plenty of time to find the lecture hall for my 7:00 a.m.
        grand-rounds presentation. “Grand rounds,” if you aren’t familiar with the phrase, are a weekly event
        for medical teaching institutions, and usually involve a presentation on a particular malady or patient
        profile. Today, I would be the presenter, the audience would be a group of neurosurgery residents, and
        the topics would be mindfulness and attention.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I got my slides set up and waited patiently to
        begin. The clock </span><span class="calibre4">ticked ticked ticked</span><span>. Now it was 6:55 and
        not a soul was in the lecture hall. Had I gotten the day wrong? At 6:57, the doors burst open with a
        blast of noise and clamoring voices as some forty people rushed in to find a seat. Every chair in the
        room quickly filled. I was relieved—I hadn’t gotten the day wrong, after all.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>But as I began my talk, my relief faded. I
        wasn’t sure what exactly was going on, but I definitely didn’t feel that I had an interested audience.
        Phones buzzed. Chatter rippled through the room. People shifted about, rustled paper. There was a
        palpable restlessness in the air. I felt good about the material I presented, but when I finished I
        walked out of that lecture hall thinking it was the worst presentation I’d ever given. So I was
        dumbfounded to get a call, a week later, from the chief of neurosurgery. He told me my talk had been a
        hit. </span><span class="calibre4">Really?</span><span> I thought. </span><span class="calibre4">But
        they seemed so distracted!</span><span> Then he asked me if I could train all the residents in
        mindfulness.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“They need it,” he said.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>And, he added, he needed it too. He shared a
        recent experience. He regularly performed demanding, highly technical brain surgeries that could last up
        to eight hours at a time—a really long time to stand, tinkering with near-microscopic-precision inside
        an exposed human brain. The problem was that recently he was finding himself distracted. Not just during
        lectures, but during surgery. Hearing my talk helped him realize that his mind was
        wandering</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.
        a </span><span class="calibre4">lot.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>He described an episode that was emblematic of
        a larger pattern not just for him but for many surgeons. One night, he had a disagreement with his wife
        that got rather heated and went unresolved. The next day, in the middle of a surgery, one of the nurses
        came in to deliver a phone message to him. It was not unusual for him to receive messages or answer
        questions during the course of a surgery—brain surgeries like the ones he performed stretched through a
        whole day. But this time, the message was from his wife and was related to the argument they’d been
        having the night before. He could feel how difficult it was to return his full focus to the incredibly
        high-stakes surgery he was performing. The message was an intrusion. But even before the nurse walked in
        with that slip of paper, he’d been mentally traveling back in time to the disagreement. Why? Because of
        a very common need we all have, something </span><a name="epubbookmark89"></a><span>referred to as a
        need for </span><span class="calibre4">cognitive closure</span><span>. This is that tug of wanting to
        achieve a resolution to something that is confusing, unsettling, or even ambiguous. While the surgery
        was properly in the foreground of his attention, whenever his mind would drift, it drifted to how to
        resolve the disagreement with his wife.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Very far from any operating rooms, Garrett, an
        engineer for the Washington State ferry system, started looking into mindfulness training as a potential
        tool for coping with long shifts when his focused attention is required but difficult to sustain. As
        chief engineer, he spends twelve-hour night shifts in the belly of an Olympic Class ferry. It gets up to
        speeds of almost twenty knots, carries as many as 1,500 passengers and a maximum of 144 vehicles, and
        weighs more than four thousand tons. Operating one requires both precision and advanced planning—it
        takes a great deal of lead time to turn or slow one of these white-and-green whales. Much of Garrett’s
        job requires standing in front of gauges and other meters, monitoring every dial to ensure that
        everything is working correctly, and standing at the ready to receive orders from the captain to change
        course or speed. At 3:00 a.m., on the last of many sailings, this can get challenging, and the
        consequences of a mental lapse are extremely dangerous. Missing a problem could mean millions of dollars
        in damage, or even an accident resulting in loss of life. Garrett told me, “I’m doing repetitive menial
        tasks that have enormous consequences if I mess up.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Garrett was concerned that he couldn’t sustain
        focus well enough to do his critical job safely. So he came up with his own system—he sets an alarm on
        his phone to go off every ten minutes. When it buzzes, he starts at the first display and works his way
        through a check of everything. Without it, he could easily get lost in thought, and the minutes would
        slip away like the water rushing under the hull.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>To the chief of neurosurgery I said, “Well,
        first of all, ask your staff to stop giving you messages during surgery! But we can do more.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>And to the chief ferry engineer, “It’s good
        that you’re aware of your attentional limits and set up a system to help. But we can do more.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>It’s not realistic to expect someone to stay
        focused through an eight-hour surgery or twelve-hour night shift on dark waters. It’s not even realistic
        to expect them to do so for a single half-hour ferry crossing. Our focus—our </span><span
        class="calibre4">flashlight</span><span>—is very easily impacted. If you didn’t get through all five
        breaths in that exercise above—if you didn’t even get through </span><span
        class="calibre4">one</span><span>—don’t feel bad. Your attention is built to behave this way.
      </span><span class="calibre4">Why?</span><span> The answer to that is rooted in some of the most basic ways
        the human brain’s attention system functions, and will lead us through the major neuroscience concepts
        I’ll unpack in this chapter, </span><a name="epubbookmark90"></a><span class="calibre4">load
        theory</span><span>, </span><span class="calibre4">mind-wandering</span><span>, </span><a
        name="epubbookmark91"></a><span>and the </span><span class="calibre4">vigilance decrement</span><span>,
        along with the implications for each when it comes to training your attention. Learning about these will
        enable you to understand how your flashlight is working now, recognize the challenges it faces, and
        learn to control it with greater ease. The first thing to get clear about is what’s happening when you
        start to become “mentally fatigued” and feel yourself losing the ability to focus. It can seem as if
        you’re “leaking” attentional resources, as if your cognitive gas tank were running low. It makes sense
        intuitively—this notion that you’ve been burning cognitive fuel through your day, or through a task, and
        now you’re running out. But that’s not actually how it works.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead1" style="margin:20.25pt 5pt 10.8pt"><span class="calibre6">Load Theory</span><span>:
        Attention Is Not a Gas Tank</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Attention never vanishes, even though it might
        feel as if it does when you’re struggling to focus and simply can’t. When attention begins to get
        fatigued or degraded, it makes it harder to place your attention where you want it. But it doesn’t just
        fade away. In cognitive neuroscience, this is explained through </span><span class="calibre4">load
        theory.</span><span> What load theory boils down to is this: the amount of attention you have remains
        constant. It just gets used differently, and maybe not how you want it to be used.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Take the example of my navigating Highway 17
        through the Santa Cruz mountains. The demands (or “load” in neuroscience-speak) were low during the
        leisurely part of my drive, while during the treacherous part my attention was distributed differently.
        During the low-load portion of the drive, I had attentional resources available to engage in other types
        of thought—planning, daydreaming, enjoying the scenery, listening to music. When the load was high, I
        didn’t have the bandwidth for that—all my attentional resources were focused on the task-at-hand:
        driving safely toward my destination. Yet the total </span><span class="calibre4">amount</span><span> of
        attention did not change. You can think of it like this: You always use 100 percent of your attention.
        Attention always goes somewhere. So the question becomes: </span><span class="calibre4">Where?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="chaphead1" style="margin:20.25pt 5pt 10.8pt"><span class="calibre6">The Vigilance
        Decrement</span><span>: You’re Going to Get Worse at What You’re Doing</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Take any task that you might ask someone to do
        over a period of time and graph it: you’ll find performance declines. Errors go up, responses become
        slower and more variable. In the lab, we’ve mapped this </span><span class="calibre4">vigilance
        decrement</span><span> with a test that requires accuracy during a long, repetitive task. </span><a
        name="epubbookmark92"></a><span>Participants sit at a computer screen that shows them a different face
        every half second. They are given these instructions: When you see a face, press the space bar. But if
        you see an upside-down face, don’t press.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The results?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Wow, people are terrible at this! During the
        first five minutes of the experiment, they catch themselves and don’t press very often when the face is
        upside down. After that, they start pressing when they aren’t supposed to. Over the forty-minute study,
        their performance gets worse and worse.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>You might say, </span><span class="calibre4">Well,
        but that experiment is so boring—that’s why they stopped paying attention.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>First of all: we see this pattern of decline
        in performance over time across many tasks, ones that vary in degrees of complexity and demand. Yes, it
        happens faster with simpler tasks, but with more-complex or varied activities, the vigilance decrement
        kicks in and performance begins to steadily decline, even during a short, twenty-minute task. When you
        think about how long we regularly need to be able to accomplish things that stretch across a much longer
        time frame (think about the eight-hour critical brain surgery, the twelve-hour ferry shift at night),
        twenty minutes is a very, </span><span class="calibre4">very</span><span> short window to achieve
        accuracy and good performance. And second: the word </span><span class="calibre4">boring</span><span> is
        subjective—is brain surgery inherently boring?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>And finally: you’re right. That experiment
      </span><span class="calibre4">was</span><span> boring. Or, in more accurate terms, it was designed to
        produce boredom as quickly as possible in the laboratory so that we could investigate what was really
        going on with our attention over time. We used to think that the vigilance decrement was due to a kind
        of mental fatigue—the brain got tired, just as a muscle would when asked to perform over a long period.
        If you were asked to do a hundred bicep curls in a row, your performance would most definitely decline.
        But this didn’t mesh with what we knew about how the brain functions. It doesn’t “get tired” like an
        overworked muscle—it doesn’t work that way. Think of it in these terms: your eyes don’t stop seeing if
        you’ve had them open for a while; your ears don’t stop hearing after twenty minutes. The whole idea of
        the brain becoming fatigued didn’t really make sense. And what we found was that as performance
        declined, mind-wandering went up.</span></p>

        Dark Matter of Information Processing</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I call </span><span
        class="calibre4">mind-wandering</span><span> the “dark matter” of cognition because it’s both invisible
        and ever-present—and it has consequences. We are in a constant state of mind-wandering, yet often we
        don’t even notice. It’s a category of brain activity that falls under the general umbrella of
      </span><span class="calibre4">spontaneous thought,</span><span> which is exactly what it sounds like:
        unconstrained thinking, leading to thoughts or ideas that pop up without your conscious, voluntary
        choice.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Now, spontaneous thought can be </span><span
        class="calibre4">great.</span><span> When there’s nothing else you’re supposed to be doing and you can
        go ahead and let your thoughts roam, it can be creative, energizing, and generative. Think of taking a
        walk and allowing your mind to wander, like a dog on a long leash, exploring some flowers or hedges.
        Some of the best, most innovative ideas come from this type of spontaneous thought, which we scientists
        call </span><span class="calibre4">conscious internal reflection</span><span>, or, more simply,
        daydreaming. And it can not only lead to ideas and solutions you might not have arrived at otherwise; it
        can also be beneficial to attention, by recharging your attentional capacities, boosting your mood, and
        relieving stress.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Mind-wandering is in the same category as
        daydreaming, though it’s a quite different animal. It’s the </span><span class="calibre4">other</span><span>
        type of spontaneous thought—the kind that happens when there’s
        something you want or need to be doing, and yet your thoughts still veer away from that very task. In
        the lab, we classify it as any kind of </span><span class="calibre4">task-unrelated thought</span><span>
        (TUT for short). Think of the “taking your dog for a walk” example. On a leisurely stroll, letting your
        pup roam and explore is relaxing and harmless. But if you’re trying to get somewhere, and you have to
        keep stopping to rein him back in, over and over, it’s going to start getting problematic pretty
        quickly. It’ll be harder to watch where you’re going; it’ll take you longer to get there; you’re going
        to start getting irritated and stressed.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>There’s a big cost to task-unrelated thought.

          Remember the face/house study? We asked you to focus on the face, and in response your attention
          system amped up the face signal and dimmed everything else. Well, that’s what happens here—except
          what’s amplified is whatever you’re thinking about (when mind-wandering, you’re usually
          fast-forwarding into the future or rewinding into the past), while what’s dimmed is, well, your
          actual surroundings. It’s as if you can’t see or hear as clearly. Which leads to the next

          errors—a wandering mind is an error-prone mind. It makes sense: If your ability to perceive and
          process your surroundings is impaired, you’re going to have lapses and slip-ups. If that doesn’t
          seem like such a big problem, remember the number that kicked off this book: 50 percent, which is
          the amount of time we are mind-wandering and not fully present in what we’re doing. With anything
          you’re doing throughout your waking day, there’s a fifty-fifty chance you’re really there; anytime
          you’re talking to someone, even if you’re making direct eye contact, there’s only a fifty-fifty
          chance they’re hearing you. And remember all the studies that showed there were zero incentives or
          consequences that could persuade people to mind-wander less? They were simply not able to stop
          themselves, even if the consequences were potentially high. </span><a

          start to affect mood and stress levels. And we know how kryptonite affects our attention: higher

    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>To sum up: When you need your attention to
        accomplish a task, be it a work demand, a conversation with a child or partner, or time alone to read a

        we even </span><span class="calibre4">have</span><span> mind-wandering? When we consider that the brain
        is the success story of tens of thousands of years of evolution, we have to wonder: What possible reason
        could there be for us to have inherited this damaging, problematic tendency? </span><span class="calibre4">Why
        build a mind that wanders?</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead1" style="margin:20.25pt 5pt 10.8pt"><span>Why We Wander</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Let’s rewind some twelve thousand years.
        Picture yourself in the forest. You’re hunting for an animal, perhaps, or for edible berries—you need
        your focus to be able to find something to feed yourself today. We already know what happens to your
        attention system when you’re scanning for something specific: your brain is now biased (selectively
        attuned) to a specific set of colors, sounds, and smells. When you spot the flash of movement behind a
        screen of leaves, or the specific hue and shape of a delicious fruit, your focus narrows and everything
        else falls away. You close in. And
        then</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.
        you get eaten by the tiger that you didn’t even notice was there.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Would a mind that wandered have saved you?
        It’s possible! Perhaps the early humans who toggled in and out of focus, those who </span><span
        class="calibre4">got distracted</span><span> and looked up every now and then—pulled out of their task
        by a wandering mind—were the ones who realized they were in danger of becoming prey themselves and acted
        appropriately, surviving to pass on their (distractible) genes.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>In the lab, we’d observed across multiple
        studies how the human brain will </span><span class="calibre4">actively resist</span><span> staying
        focused on a task. The mind was determined, it seems, to roam. To figure out why, we needed to consider
        that, as destructive and problematic as we knew mind-wandering was, it could also be seen,
        paradoxically, as an asset.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>To take you through how we investigated this,
        I first have to point out the difference between </span><span class="calibre4">voluntary
        attention</span><span> and </span><span class="calibre4">automatic attention.</span><span> Voluntary
        attention, as you can probably guess, is when you choose where to point your flashlight; automatic
        attention is when your attention is captured and pulled toward something without your active choice.
      </span><span class="calibre4">Attention-grabbing:</span><span> it’s a figure of speech, but a very accurate
        one. Think of using a flashlight in the dark. You choose to point it ahead of you to illuminate your
        path: </span><span class="calibre4">voluntary attention. Now</span><span> think of what happens if you
        were to hear a sudden sound off to the side—the snap of a branch, for example. You’d instinctively swing
        the flashlight in that direction. You’d do it without even thinking: </span><span class="calibre4">automatic
        attention.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Here’s how we test this in the lab:</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The computer shows a large blank screen with a
        plus sign (+) in the middle; we tell you to keep your eyes resting on that plus sign. The reason: your
        eyes and your attention are generally yoked together, but you can decouple them in certain situations
        (think of focusing on someone you’re talking to at a party, while your attention shifts to the
        conversation behind you—eyes and attention decouple). For this experiment, we want to make sure the
      </span><span class="calibre4">only</span><span> thing that moves is your attention.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Your job: Press the space bar when you detect
        a large X on either the right or the left side of the screen. When you spot it, hit that bar as fast as
        you can. The twist: Sometimes there’s a flash of light that appears </span><span
        class="calibre4">immediately</span><span> before the X does. And sometimes that flash happens in the
        same spot as where the X will appear; other times not. You’re instructed not to worry about that flash.
        Just press when you spot the X, no matter where it happens. That’s it.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Pretty simple, right? It is. But we’re looking
        at how long it takes for participants to respond when they’re cued by the flash of light versus when
        they’re not. And as you can probably guess, when the flash of light precedes where the target will
        appear, the responses are much faster and more accurate.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Nothing may seem earth-shattering about
        this—obviously, the flash of light got their attention. Well, </span><span
        class="calibre4">exactly.</span><span> The flash “got” their attention. What this shows us is that
        attention can be drawn without our conscious or active choice. If somebody shouts your name on a busy
        street, your attention snaps to their voice. You didn’t make the choice to place it there. And
        (crucially, for this discussion) there’s nothing you can do to </span><span class="calibre4">stop</span><span>
        it. This is probably something you already know intuitively—you don’t
        need me to tell you how it feels when you hear a distinctive buzz and your focus immediately flickers
        from whatever you were doing to the lit-up screen of your phone. What’s important about this study is
        that it’s demonstrably true that attention functions in this way. It doesn’t just </span><span
        class="calibre4">feel</span><span> as if you can’t easily stop your brain from attending to these
        distractions—you actually, literally, can’t.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>That gives us one level of understanding as to
        why your mind might wander away from a task: a distraction pops up, either from the environment
        (external) or from your own mind (internal), and your automatic attention bops right over to it. And
        that does explain some of the mind-wandering we do. But there’s more to it than that. Let’s go back to
        the screen with the flash and the target “X.” I want to show you how we take it one step further—to
        investigate a really fascinating phenomenon in the brain—by making one teeny, tiny adjustment to this
        experiment.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Just as before, we show you the flash. And
        just as before, it appears exactly where the X is about to appear (cued) or not</span><span
        class="calibre4">.</span><span> But instead of presenting the target immediately after the flash, we
        pause </span><span class="calibre4">ever so slightly—</span><span>to the tune of a few hundred
        milliseconds—before we show you the target. And you’re much slower. That advantage you got from the
        warning of the flash, that speedy edge? Gone.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>But wait—</span><span
        class="calibre4">why</span><span>? If the flash pulled your automatic attention to the specific location
        where the target was about to appear, how on earth would you miss it now? What difference does a couple
        hundred milliseconds make?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Let’s hit the slo-mo button and go through
        what happens, beat by beat:</span></p>
    <ol type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt">
      <li class="num" style="margin-top:18pt; margin-right:5pt; margin-left:41pt"><span>The flash appears in the

          class="calibre4">not</span><span> appear there.</span></li>
      <li class="bul" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:41pt"><span>Your attention now dismisses (in
          neuroscience-speak: “disadvantages”) that side of the screen as an area of interest.</span></li>
      <li class="bul" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:41pt"><span>Your attention shifts to the other side of
          the

        <span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>. and when the target appears,
          late, in the original spot, you’re slower at detecting it. You’re faster, however, at detecting the
          X on the other side.</span>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><a name="epubbookmark97"></a><span>We call this
        phenomenon the </span><span class="calibre4">inhibition of return</span><span>: Your attention is, quite
        literally, inhibited from returning to that original location. If your attentional flashlight is drawn
        to a certain spot, and nothing happens or appears there, you’ll automatically disadvantage that space.
        In other words, you eliminate it as an area of interest. And let me emphasize: this happens </span><span
        class="calibre4">fast.</span><span> It takes only five hundred milliseconds, total, for all these steps
        to occur in rapid succession, without your even being aware of them! And this happens across all types
        of sensory input. In the first study I published on this, we did it with sounds, and found the
        same</span><span class="calibre4">.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Why does your brain do this? Well, it’s likely
        a scanning strategy</span><span class="calibre4">.</span><span> Imagine yourself once again in the shoes
        of that imaginary ancestor in the long-ago woods. You’re hunting or foraging, while also trying to be
        aware of </span><span class="calibre4">being</span><span> hunted. You hear something off to the left.
        Boom, your attention automatically goes there and scans the area. If you see/hear/smell nothing, your
        attention rapidly moves on and begins scanning the other areas around you—because whatever it was that
        made that sound is probably still close by, and it probably moved.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Obviously, we’re no longer hunter-gatherers.
        You’re not out there in your day-to-day life hunting for food or being stalked by a tiger. But it’s
        important to recognize that while the </span><span class="calibre4">origins</span><span> of this brain
        activity might lie with our distant ancestors, this pattern isn’t outdated—it still serves you in all
        kinds of situations. And while we contrive situations in the lab where we study either automatic
        attention or voluntary attention, in our everyday life we use both, and there is a constant dynamic
        interplay between them.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The human brain is efficient and strategic.
        It’s always trying to maximize its activity for the greatest possible gain. </span><a
        name="epubbookmark98"></a><span>Mind-wandering may have ultimately been selected for over the course of
        human evolution to maximize </span><span class="calibre4">opportunity costs</span><span>—the brain
        predicts that whatever it’s giving up (focus and follow-through for the task-at-hand) is worth it in the
        long run for a larger potential gain (whether it be survival, protection, or finding out what else is
        out there that might be better). Boredom, as I said, is subjective—anything can get boring. Boredom
        might very well have evolved in order to simply force us to go find something else to do. We used to
        believe that the vigilance decrement was exclusively driven by mental fatigue, as we spend our cognitive
        resources. But I think (and others do, too) that it’s actually more than just that. It’s likely linked
        back to this essential survival mechanism. What this all means for you—a modern, twenty-first-century
        human—is that if you try to sustain your focus for a long time, you will begin to experience your
        attention resisting, and eventually scattering off in some way.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I’ve taken you through all this nitty-gritty
        cognitive science because I think of it as an opportunity—to realize that you’re biologically
        predisposed to mind-wandering, and to embrace it (to a certain extent) as a necessary “capacity” you
        have. If you had a brain that wasn’t susceptible to it, you could drive yourself in the wrong direction
        or no direction. Some people diagnosed with attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) will often
        report that the problem is not that they can’t focus—it’s that they get focused on the </span><span
        class="calibre4">wrong thing</span><span>. When we get overly focused, we can lose track of our
        in-the-moment goals. We lose touch with whether our current behavior </span><span
        class="calibre4">aligns</span><span> with those goals. And we don’t realize when we need to
        course-correct or address curveballs (</span><span class="calibre4">tigers!</span><span>) that come our
        way. There can be a real benefit to a waxing and waning of focus, and this is something we’ll be talking
        about. But just because this mental behavior has potential benefits doesn’t mean it’s always the right
        way to be. And just because we’re neurologically predisposed to it doesn’t mean we have to simply accept
        it.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>Let’s Recap!</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>That was a fair amount of information we just
        whipped through. And as we already know, you might have missed a chunk of it. It’s not your fault. Thank
        your savvy ancestors’ survival instincts! Let’s do a quick review.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Because you always use 100 percent of your
        attention (</span><span class="calibre4">load theory</span><span>), it always goes somewhere, so if
        you’re not focused on your current demands, it may very well be because you are mind-wandering
        (experiencing </span><span class="calibre4">task-unrelated thought</span><span>) and are not mentally
        present in your current surroundings (</span><span class="calibre4">perceptual decoupling</span><span>).
        Mind-wandering is something your brain is predisposed to do, for various reasons involving, but not
        limited to, fast-moving saber-toothed tigers (</span><span class="calibre4">inhibition of
        return</span><span>), and it likely drives the </span><span class="calibre4">vigilance
        decrement</span><span>, which ensures that the longer you do something, the worse you’ll perform. While
        mind-wandering may have its roots in something useful (</span><span class="calibre4">opportunity costs,
      </span><a name="epubbookmark99"></a><span class="calibre4">attentional cycling</span><span>), it’s bad for
        our ability to perform well on what we are trying to do (our “task-at-hand”) and our mood.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Now that we know </span><span
        class="calibre4">why</span><span> we wander, we need to talk about what we can do about it. The first
        step is a simple one:</span></p>
    <p class="extracts" style="margin:12pt 14pt"><span class="calibre5">LEARN TO RECOGNIZE THAT YOU’RE
        MIND-WANDERING</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>A few years after I had my crisis of
        attention, my husband was plunged into one of his own. Since he’d started a demanding graduate program,
        both of us were doing our best juggling the demands of work and parenting one small child, and then two,
        after our daughter, Sophie, came along. Once he began his program’s finite math sequence, Michael was
        having so much trouble focusing that he participated in a pilot program we ran on adults with ADHD,
        where we tested whether mindfulness training could help. We didn’t ask participants to go off their
        prescribed medications if they were taking any—instead, we wanted to see whether mindfulness training
        could help strengthen attention wherever they were starting from, meds or no meds, so that we could
        measure any improvement from their baselines.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><a name="epubbookmark100"></a><span>They
      </span><span class="calibre4">did</span><span> improve. The common feedback we got from participants was
        that they didn’t change their medication because of the training, but they reported being able to
      </span><span class="calibre4">use it more effectively.</span><span> What our participants reported was a
        better ability to notice where their flashlights were pointing and to be able to redirect them when
        necessary. One sample comment: “I’m not just sitting in front of the computer all day going from website
        to website. Instead, I’m aware of what I’m trying to do, and I’m </span><span
        class="calibre4">deciding</span><span> to use my attention to do it.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>One of the activities we conducted was having
        a recording of a bell sound every five minutes. The idea was that people would use it during a formal
        mindfulness exercise to remind themselves to bring their focus back to the task-at-hand. But after the
        first few weeks, my husband brought that dinging bell recording home to use while he did his homework in
        the evenings. It helped so much that he started playing it all day long at work. He’d realized that he
        was off-task frequently and used that reminder, every five minutes, to come back to what he was trying
        to do.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>It was a real wake-up call for me about how
        common this problem is, and how much help we need. Just a few years before, I was doing my own
        personalized mindfulness “case study” on myself, and one of the first things I noticed in my earliest
        sessions was how often my mind jumped like a grasshopper all over the place. Then I noticed that it
        wasn’t only happening during those few minutes every morning when I sat down to do this still-unfamiliar
        practice. It was happening </span><span class="calibre4">constantly.</span><span> I was shocked by how
        much I was mind-wandering throughout my day. I started checking in with myself to see how often I was
        actually on-task.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The answer? Not very often.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>For both Michael and me, the essential step
        was realizing how much of the time our flashlight was pointed somewhere we didn’t want it. Try this: for
        the rest of the day, start checking in with yourself every so often and notice when you’re on-task and
        when you’re not. You might even set up your phone to ping you. If you don’t want bells going off every
        five minutes all day long, as my husband did, you might set it for every hour. When the alert pops up on
        your phone, do a quick check-in, and be honest with yourself: What were you doing? What were you
        thinking about? </span><span class="calibre4">Where</span><span> were you, really?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>If it works for you, use the chart </span><a
        href="#epubbookmark101" style="text-decoration:none"><span class="calibre1">below</span></a><span> to
        keep track over the course of one day. (Or make one in a notebook you can carry, or even in the Notes
        app on your phone. This needs to be easily accessible so that it’s quick and easy to accomplish.) Jot
        down the time, your task, and where your flashlight is. When you look back at the chart at the end of
        the day or week, you should get a fairly clear picture of not only how often you’re off-task, but also
        where you tend to go.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Since we tend to engage in mental time travel
        whenever we mind-wander, you may find yourself in the future, planning and worrying—or you may get
        pulled into the past, into rumination loops. (Rest assured, I’ll address this soon.) Either way,
        gathering data on </span><span class="calibre4">what</span><span> pulls you out of the present moment
        and </span><span class="calibre4">how often</span><span> it does so will be helpful moving forward. It’s
        going to give you a leg up in terms of identifying and addressing any challenges you may be
        experiencing.</span></p>

    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>You might notice that you’re frequently pulled
        off-task by digital distractions like email, texts and phone calls, social media, and so on. It’s
        tempting to think that if we could just eliminate those distractions, we’d be all set.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>Our Crisis of Attention: Is It Digital?</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We’re bombarded by the idea that at the root of
        our attention issues lies a single powerful culprit: modern technology. If we truly want to focus, it
        seems, we need to turn off all our devices, quit social media, and retreat into the woods for a digital
        detox.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Here’s my resistance to that idea. At an
        elemental level, this particular era is no different than any other—there has always been a “crisis of
        attention.” Historically, people have turned to meditation (and other forms of contemplative practice)
        to deal with feelings of being overwhelmed and scattered in focus, and to refocus and reflect on
        priorities—our inner values, intentions, purpose. This can certainly be a spiritual process, if that’s
        how you define it. But we’re discovering that mindfulness impacts the attention system and how it copes
        with the distractions that surround us—and those that are generated internally. In part, that’s what
        meditation practitioners have always been pursuing. Think about life long ago: people in ancient India
        or medieval Europe didn’t have smartphones and Facebook, but they were still suffering in their own
        minds. They still turned to any number of practices for relief. They still described the same challenge:
      </span><span class="calibre4">I’m not fully present for my life.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>A crisis of attention can happen anytime you
        don’t allow yourself a break—when you don’t allow your mind to “rest” without having any task-at-hand.
        Remember our distinction between </span><span class="calibre4">mind-wandering</span><span> (having
        off-task thoughts during a task) and </span><span class="calibre4">daydreaming</span><span> (task-free
        spontaneous thought and opportunity for conscious reflection, creativity, and the like)? Well, one
        problem today is that we are </span><span class="calibre4">always engaged</span><span> in something.
        With these digital tools at our fingertips, we have constant access to all these forms of communication,
        content, and interaction, and we don’t tend to gravitate toward letting our thoughts meander,
        unconstrained. Of the two types of spontaneous thought we discussed earlier, it’s the beneficial
        type—the daydreaming—that we barely get at all. When was the last time you stood in line at a store and
        just</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.
        looked around? Thought about whatever surfaced in your mind? Or did you pull out your phone, check your
        texts, read your email?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We all do it. I catch myself all the time,
        going from one type of mental engagement to the next. I call it </span><span
        class="calibre4">hypertasking.</span><span> Like surfing hyperlinks online (clicking from link to link
        as they grab your attention), we go from one task to the next and the next. You are probably doing it
        right now. We are “all task and no downtime.” And we’re asking an enormous amount—too much—from our
        attention systems. Your attentional capacity is not </span><span class="calibre4">less</span><span> than
        someone’s from hundreds of years ago. It’s only that right now, you’re using your attention in a
        particular focused way, all the time. We’re taxing our focused attention to the max. Hypertasking is
        hyper-taxing! Even something you might think of as relaxing (scrolling through Instagram, for example,
        or reading an article someone shared) is more engagement. It’s </span><span class="calibre4">another
        task.</span><span> Checking your notifications may seem “fun,” but it’s work for your attention. Task:
        check to see who posted what in response to my post. Task: check how many likes I got. Task: check who
        shared my funny meme. Your attention was focused on task after task after task, with no attentional
        downtime, not a moment for the mind to roam free.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>It’s not always realistic to unplug. We can’t
        just turn off our phones and pause our email. We cannot create a distraction-free world. The issue is
        not the existence of this technology; rather, it’s how we’re using it: we are not allowing our minds to
        pay attention </span><span class="calibre4">differently.</span><span> And this is where mindfulness
        comes in, as a way to steady your flashlight so you don’t end up swinging it around at any and all
        possible distractions—digital or not.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>Finding Your Flashlight</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>To find your focus, the first skill you need to
        develop is to </span><span class="calibre4">notice</span><span> when your attentional flashlight has
        wandered away from the task-at-hand. In this first “core exercise,” your goal is to repeatedly find your
        flashlight. </span><span class="calibre4">This is the workout:</span><span> orient attention to a target
        object, notice when it wanders off-target, and then reorient it back to the target.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Think of this like training a puppy. Wandering
        around is just what puppies do. No need to be harsh or mean. But you should be consistent and clear with
        your instruction, over and over again. If the puppy does not follow a command, we don’t indulge stories
        about how bad, flawed, untrainable, or unlovable the puppy is. Instead, we simply begin the training
        exercise again. Adopt a similar </span><span class="calibre4">supportive-yet-firm</span><span> attitude
        as you engage in this workout—and notice when old mental habits like justifying, chastising, or
        ruminating show up when you notice your mind-wandering. Now, reframe “mind-wandering” itself: it’s not a
        failure or error, but rather a cue to begin again and reorient back to the target object. The more often
        you gently guide your attention back, the more easily it will follow—just as your puppy will learn to
        do. Your mind will begin to get more attuned to noticing when you’ve wandered off, as well: with more
        practice, you’ll grow more able to notice the </span><span class="calibre4">initial</span><span> pull on
        your flashlight away from the target object, instead of becoming completely lost or hijacked before you
        do. All this will make bringing it back to the target easier, too. When we are able to find our focus
        more easily, we waste less time, experience fewer dips in mood and fewer spikes in stress, and worry
        less when we have something important to get done—whether for work, for others, or for yourself.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>And interestingly, just as you improve your
        ability to notice when your mind has wandered, you begin to notice when you may need to truly let it
        freely roam. When we got our dog, Tashi, I loved taking him to the dog park for this very reason. Once
        the leash was removed, he was off, exploring, playing, running free. I felt like I was seeing a new part
        of him, his curious, exuberant-friendly-joyful side. And for those few minutes, I would choose not to
        take out my phone. I let myself get reacquainted with my mind without an agenda—no problem to ponder, no
        emails to answer. This small act was like a gift I gave myself. I noticed creative ideas bubbling up, a
        feeling of good-heartedness reemerging, and a buoyant energy returning back to me. Tashi and I would
        both return home with an extra little bounce in our steps. But I would not have been able to really let
        go of my flashlight if I didn’t know where it was or how to hold it in the first place.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>To find your flashlight, you’ll draw on a
        foundational mindfulness practice often called </span><span class="calibre4">breath
        awareness.</span><span> This practice has been around for millennia. Contemplative traditions tell us
        that it cultivates concentrative focus. And now we know, after many studies, that it is also part of a
        suite of practices that can serve as cognitive training for attention. Breath awareness can seem
        deceptively simple: </span><span class="calibre4">focus your attention on your breath, and when the mind
        wanders, return it</span><span>. The instructions are quite basic, yet what the exercise is actually
        doing to your brain’s attention system is anything but. The breath awareness exercise targets
      </span><span class="calibre4">all three</span><span> systems of attention, because it allows you to practice
      </span><span class="calibre4">focusing—</span><span>as you </span><span class="calibre4">orient</span><span>
        attention to the </span><span class="calibre4">breath; noticing</span><span>—staying </span><span
        class="calibre4">alert</span><span> and monitoring ongoing mental activity to detect
        mind-wandering</span><span class="calibre4">;</span><span> and </span><span
        class="calibre4">redirecting—executive</span><span> management of cognitive processes to make sure we
        return and remain on-task</span><span class="calibre4">.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Why do we use the breath? We could potentially
        place our focus on any number of things. Training the flashlight of your attention on anything, and then
        bringing it back when it wobbles away, can certainly help you, and in fact I encourage you to try this
        during the day when there’s something you want to bring your full attention to: listening to a lecture,
        briefing, or podcast; reading or writing a report; practicing a musical instrument. But for this daily
        practice, we use the breath for a couple of important reasons: It anchors us in the body. It allows us
        to experience the body sensations that are unfolding in real time as we breathe, in the here and now.
        This helps us more easily catch when our minds have wandered away from these sensations to thoughts
        about the past or future. And finally, our breath is always with us. It’s the most natural built-in
        target for our attention that we can always return to.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Your breath is a changing, dynamic target, and
        in this exercise, your attention is to be constrained to a single, prominent, breath-related sensation
        in a specific body part (like your chest, nose, abdomen). The key is to select a specific target object
        and stick with it for the duration of the formal exercise. Remember that this is a concentrative
        practice—the flashlight’s beam is narrow and steady on the target. One of the next practices will ask
        you to take that beam of your attention and sweep it through the body; later, we’ll progress to a
        practice where you have no target to focus on, but will be monitoring the shifting contents of your
        moment-to-moment conscious experience—your memories, emotions, thoughts, and sensations—</span><span
        class="calibre4">without</span><span> getting caught up and swept away by them. To succeed at any of
        these later practices, you need to strengthen your flashlight first. And all these together are helping
        you learn how to </span><span class="calibre4">pay attention to your attention</span><span>.</span></p>

        pretty simple. But in its simplicity lies its beauty </span><span class="calibre4">and</span><span> its
        utility: in that one basic exercise, we’ve figured out how to do two difficult things that we were most
        likely completely challenged by and largely unaware of before—noticing our mind-wandering, then
        redirecting our attention. As I hope you now know, mind-wandering is ubiquitous, it’s common, and
        there’s no reason to fight against it—it’s just the nature of the mind. If you are conscious,
        mind-wandering will happen. But for the “formal” period of time you dedicate to doing the core breath
        awareness practice, during which you sit down to practice and point your flashlight intentionally at
        your breath, we do something different when mind-wandering occurs: we note it and then redirect our
        attention back.</span></p>

        the “push-up” of a mindfulness breathing exercise. I hope you’re getting a sense of how doing this

        and over.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>An important question: </span><span
        class="calibre4">How long should I practice?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I told you earlier that twelve minutes was the
        “magic number,” and in the final chapter of this book, </span><a href="#epubfile15"
        style="text-decoration:none"><span class="calibre1">“Feel the Burn,”</span></a><span> we’ll be talking
        more about that “minimum dose” required for truly transforming your attention system. But just as you
        wouldn’t start physical training by trying to bench-press your own weight, you’re not going to start
        mental training by sitting down to a long mindfulness practice session right off the bat.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I recommend starting small. Try three
        minutes—set a timer on your phone. </span><span class="calibre4">Three minutes</span><span>: That’s less
        time than it takes to boil water or make toast. Less time than even the quickest shower. I’ve waited for
        elevators that took longer than three minutes to arrive.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>A heads-up: three minutes might be quick, but
        when you are new to mindfulness meditation practice, even a minute or two can feel like forever. You
        will probably have to move your flashlight back to your breath so many times, you’ll wonder how you ever
        get anything done! Know this: </span><span class="calibre4">it will get better.</span><span> If you
        commit to daily practice—starting with just </span><span class="calibre4">three minutes per
        day</span><span>—you’ll be laying the groundwork for a potentially transformative mental workout
        regimen. So start small, but do it consistently. It will be easier to expand your workout once you
        already have a place for it in your day. If you find you would like to continue beyond the three
        minutes, of course feel free to continue practicing, but don’t feel you “have” to go beyond the time
        you’ve set as your goal.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Now that you have a sense of the work involved
        in using your flashlight, here’s a final, but very important, directive to keep at the front of your
        mind:</span></p>
    <p class="extracts" style="margin:12pt 14pt"><span class="calibre5">DON’T MULTITASK!</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>When Leo was in the fifth grade, he started to
        get bothered when he noticed people talking on their cell phones as they drove alongside our car. As a
        curious, smart kid, interested in lots of things, including what I was working on in the lab, he
        certainly knew more about brain science and attention than your average ten-year-old. He figured that
        trying to do two things at once, when each required a certain level of focus (talking, driving), was
        going to take a toll. So he set out to test it.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>For a school science project, he set up an
        experiment: He had some friends come over and play car-racing video games on our Xbox 360 console in the
        living room. He’d call them on his phone from the next room and engage them in conversation while they
        were on speakerphone, asking them all kinds of questions. No surprise: the kids who were talking on the
        phone performed worse in the game than the ones who weren’t.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I admit—this is a fifth-grade science fair
        project. But as it turns out, the science backs the kid up! </span><a
        name="epubbookmark102"></a><span>Multitasking—or, more specifically, </span><span class="calibre4">task
        switching—</span><span>is terrible for our performance, accuracy, and mood. Leo was gratified but
        indignant: </span><span class="calibre4">Why was it legal to talk on the phone while
        driving?</span><span> To his credit, a lot of states now have strict laws prohibiting the use of
        handheld phones and sending or receiving texts while driving—but the reality is that, given what we know
        about attention, the laws don’t go far enough. When we try to do two things at once that both require
        our attention, it’s really hard to do either of them well. It doesn’t matter if you’re holding your
        phone or not. Hands-free or talk-to-text still require attentional engagement.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Think of it this way: You only have one
        flashlight. Not two. Not three. And your one flashlight can only ever be shining at one thing at a time.
        (To be clear: I’m speaking of tasks that require your active, focused attention—not “procedural” tasks
        like, say, </span><span class="calibre4">walking</span><span>, which doesn’t demand attention in the
        same way.) When you’re trying to accomplish multiple tasks at once that require your focused attention,
        what you’re actually doing is moving your flashlight from one thing, then to the next, then back to the
        first</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.
        and you get it. Why is that a problem? This comes back to our conversation about </span><span
        class="calibre4">biasing.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>When you select and engage in a task—whether
        it’s writing a legal brief, planning a budget, watching your child biking in the driveway, puzzling
        through the development of an app you’re building, </span><span class="calibre4">anything</span><span>—your
        attention </span><span class="calibre4">calibrates
        information processing</span><span> to that specific task. What that means: everything that your brain
        is doing is now in service to that job, and it aligns all its activity to that goal. In the lab, I could
        show you this by having you identify dots (hit the space bar when you see a red one) or letters (hit the
        shift key when you see the letter “T”) as fast as you can. If you get nothing but dots repeatedly,
        you’re going to be really fast and accurate at identifying the red ones. Same with the letter “T.” But
        when I interleave the two tasks, so that you have to do the dot task for less than a minute and then
        switch to the letter task and then go back to the dot task, back and forth repeatedly, your speed and
        accuracy take a huge hit. It’s because your attention has to recalibrate after every switch.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>In real life, of course, we’re not exactly
        dealing with dots and letters. We’re switching from crafting an email to taking a phone call; from
        taking the phone call to talking to the person who walked into the room and started speaking; from
        wrapping up that meeting to adding stuff to your calendar, and on and on and on. And recalibration to a
        new task-at-hand takes time and energy. There will always be a lag.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>To get a sense of what this means for your
        cognition, imagine a studio apartment. There is only one room. Every time you want to use the room, you
        have to completely change out the furniture. Want to sleep? Set up a bed and nightstand. Want to host a
        party? Take down the bedroom and set up couches and coffee tables. Need to cook? Drag that all away and
        set up a stove, counter, and cooking supplies. Sound exhausting? </span><span class="calibre4">It
        is!</span><span> And it’s the same for your cognition, when you switch from task to task.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>In a day when you do a lot of task switching,
        you’ll start having less integrity in </span><span class="calibre4">any</span><span> of the states your
        attention is in. That living room is going to
        look</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.
        disorganized. Your kitchen won’t have the stove plugged in. You’re going to become slower, more error
        prone, and emotionally worn down. What that will feel like to you is mental fatigue. And what it’ll show
        if we brought you into the lab is that not only are you slower, but, worse, your mind-wandering is going
        way up. And to escalate everything, the mind-wandering itself will require more task switching, over and
        over, </span><span class="calibre4">back</span><span> to the task-at-hand. Which means things get even
        slower. Errors go up. And mood goes down.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The solution? Well, one is to start the
        mindfulness training exercises, which will help you in any instance when mind-wandering becomes an
        issue. </span><a name="epubbookmark103"></a><span>But also: </span><span class="calibre4">monotask as
        much as possible.</span><span> Get rid of the problematic idea that “multitasking” is impressive,
        desirable, or superior. And when task switching seems unavoidable—as it sometimes is in real
        life!—realize that you’re going to be slower. That you will need a moment to reengage. If you take your
        time, accepting and then facilitating the “recalibration lag” of task switching, you may very well be
        faster and more efficient in the long run. </span><a name="epubbookmark104"></a><span>You’ll miss less,
        make fewer errors, and (science suggests!) stay happier.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>When she was president of the University of
        Miami, I remember walking into Dr. Donna Shalala’s office for a meeting—I’m sure it was one of many she
        would have that day. She was deeply engaged in writing an email when I arrived. She didn’t even look up.
        As I stood waiting, she continued typing, her focus seemingly unbroken. It probably only took a minute
        tops, but it felt much longer. Then she closed her laptop, took a brief pause before she looked up, and
        gave me what felt like her </span><span class="calibre4">full</span><span> attention. I have to say, the
        difference was palpable. It set the tone for the entire meeting—and I don’t think she missed a word I
        said.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Several years later, I had the honor of
        speaking to a retired three-star general who had not only worked with many other senior military
        leaders, but also served as an advisor to them after he retired. I asked him what he noticed as a common
        feature across these incredibly successful individuals. He said that one thing stood out. He called it
        “pivot leadership.” From what he observed, there was no residue from the last event, meeting, or
        gathering to the next one. The leader could completely pivot, with 100 percent of her or his full
        attention.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The moral of the story is: monotask when you
        can, accept the lag of task switching when you must, and do your best to reduce its effects.
      </span><span class="calibre4">Give yourself time so that you’re not still trying to process the old task,
        and then fully shift your attention to the new task.</span><span> Of course, being able to do this
        requires becoming more </span><span class="calibre4">aware</span><span> of what’s happening in the
        moment, including where your flashlight is focused.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Finally, realize that even if you do all this,

        UNFLINCHING FOCUS</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>In the </span><a href="#epubfile5"
        style="text-decoration:none"><span class="calibre1">introduction</span></a><span> of this book, I
        compared holding your attention steady for a long period of time to being asked to hold a heavy weight.
        It wouldn’t be reasonable to expect yourself to have the endurance and muscle mass to hold up that
        weight without physical training. Yet somehow we seem to expect ourselves to be able to summon up mental
        stamina without similarly rigorous </span><span class="calibre4">mental</span><span> training. I stand
        by my point—though it was actually incomplete.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>What </span><span class="calibre4">automatic
        attention</span><span> teaches us is that our focus </span><span class="calibre4">will</span><span> be
        pulled away from the task-at-hand—there’s not much we can do to change that. And from observing
      </span><span class="calibre4">mind-wandering</span><span> we know that even if there isn’t an external
        distraction yanking us away, our minds will periodically go searching for one. When you catch yourself
        off-task, it’s not a failure or a reason to give up on attention training—</span><span class="calibre4">your
        brain was built to do this!</span><span> Even with training, we can’t expect
        ourselves to hold our focus the way we would hold a weight for an extended period. Instead, I want you
        to picture yourself dribbling a basketball:</span></p>
    <p class="num1p" style="margin-top:12pt; margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span class="calibre4">The ball
        drops away from your hand, and bounces right back.</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span class="calibre4">Your focus shifts away from
        the task-at-hand, and then comes back.</span></p>
    <p class="inparat" style="margin-top:12pt; margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Each time the ball falls
        away from your hand is either an opportunity (to reengage in your task, knowing you’re still where you
        want to be) or a vulnerability (lose the ball, then spend effort and cognitive energy getting it back).
        The more you practice mindfulness exercises, the better you get at “dribbling.” More and more, that ball
        will bounce back into your hand instead of rolling away. But you have to keep dribbling! Just as in
        basketball, there’s no other way to effectively function. If you want to be, say, the Steph Curry of
        attention skills, you can’t carry the ball across the court. You’re going to have to dribble it
        effortlessly while some of the best athletes on the planet are trying to steal that ball from you—while
        you’re getting exactly where you want to go.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I’ve been practicing mindfulness exercises
        nearly every day for a long time. At this point, I appreciate and accept that on some days I’m going to
        be more distracted than others, and that’s fine. But at the very beginning, when I was starting out, I
        remember struggling through an especially unsuccessful session and feeling defeated. My thoughts were
        pulled in so many different directions, I felt as if I was going backward, getting worse. So I inquired
        with a colleague who ran the mindfulness clinic at a major medical center. He had been meditating for
        more than thirty years. By most measures, he was an </span><span class="calibre4">expert-level</span><span>
        meditator. I asked how long he was able to hold his focus so
        I could get an idea of what to aim for as a goal. I figured, after thirty years, it had to be something
        amazing—ten minutes? Longer?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“Hmm,” he said. “The longest I can hold my
        attention without it drifting to something else? I’d guess about seven seconds.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span class="calibre4">Seven seconds?</span><span> I
        was shocked. But then I quickly remembered one of the most important tenets of mindfulness training: the
        point is </span><span class="calibre4">not</span><span> that you’re never going to get distracted.
        That’s not possible. The goal, rather, is to be able to recognize where your attention is moment to
        moment so that when you </span><span class="calibre4">do</span><span> get distracted, you can easily and
        adeptly move your flashlight back to what it needs to be on.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>And there’s another vital reason why training
        our focus is so important. It determines what goes into your </span><span class="calibre4">working
        memory</span><span>, the dynamic mental workspace that allows you to hold, temporarily, information that
        you need to use for whatever you’re doing. Think of it this way: whenever you’re thinking about
      </span><span class="calibre4">anything</span><span>—remembering something, working out a problem, mulling
        over an idea, holding onto a point you want to make while someone else is talking, visualizing
        something—you’re using your working memory to do that. We need working memory for nearly everything we
        want to do. Meanwhile, working memory is degraded by the very same forces that corrode attention—stress,
        threat, and poor mood. And at the root of most working memory failures is one of the more damaging
        habits of the mind: </span><span class="calibre4">mental time travel.</span></p>

        Prize–winning journalist. He’s written articles and books about distraction and attention and has
        requested an interview. At our appointed time, my phone buzzes with a text from him: </span><span

    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I write back, </span><span

    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Ten minutes later, he calls and starts to
        apologize. “It’s been such a day,” he says. “I—”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>And then nothing. Silence. He clearly can’t
        speak. I can tell that his brain has just—to use a technical term—glitched. Like when your computer
        freezes and that little spinning beach ball of death appears. I’m talking to a man who won a Pulitzer
        for his use of words, and he can’t utter a single one.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>He takes a deep breath and asks me if it’s
        okay if we take thirty seconds to breathe. Again, I agree. The thirty seconds go by. But now he has

    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“Can I write down a couple thoughts?” he wants

        because it’s key to understanding attention and how to train it to work better.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Working memory, as we’ve discussed, is a
        dynamic cognitive workspace you use every waking moment of every day. Don’t get thrown off by the word
      </span><span class="calibre4">memory</span><span>: this isn’t only about the storage of information. It’s a
      </span><span class="calibre4">temporary</span><span> “scratch space” that is, by necessity and evolutionary
        design, impermanent and fleeting.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“I always think of working memory as the
        mind’s very own whiteboard,” I explain to the writer when he can speak again. “But it’s a whiteboard
        with disappearing ink. And that ink vanishes pretty fast. As soon as you ‘write’ something there, the
        ink basically starts to fade.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I describe how attention feeds into working
        memory: the flashlight of your attention selects key information from your surroundings, or internal
        environment, and that goes into working memory. Just like writing on a real-life whiteboard, you can
        scribble ideas, consider concepts, deliberate decisions, notice patterns, jot down something you want to
        say</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.
        and more. Unlike a real-life whiteboard, though, this one is peculiar: the ink only stays on the board
        for a few seconds.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>A few seconds is pretty short. That’s fine,
        even helpful, if you’re moving quickly from one thing to another. But how do you keep important content
        on your whiteboard longer if you need more time? Simple: </span><span class="calibre4">keep paying
        attention to what’s there.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><a name="epubbookmark107"></a><span>Directing the
        flashlight of your attention to the contents of your working memory essentially “refreshes” that
        content. It’s as if you’re tracing over the ink as it’s fading, again and again. Stop paying
        attention—that is, move your flashlight to another target—and the ink dissipates and starts “writing”
        something else.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Because working memory is so deeply
        intertwined with attention, it’s vulnerable to those very same forces that degrade attention—threat,
        poor mood, and stress. This is in addition to other corrosive factors like sleep deprivation and
        psychological disorders such as depression, anxiety, ADHD, and PTSD. Under these pressures, this
        critical capacity doesn’t function so well. Your whiteboard rapidly becomes cluttered as your mind
        wanders, drawing in distracting content that fills up the space, leaving no room for what you actually
        want to do. As I’m explaining all this to the journalist, he suddenly cuts in.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“That’s </span><span
        class="calibre4">exactly</span><span> what was happening when I called you!” he said. “I had just gotten
        off another call. I was switching between projects. I didn’t want to leave you waiting. But my
        ‘whiteboard’ was completely full—there was no room to process anything.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>He said he needed to “clear his mind,” a
        common phrase that we’ve all probably used at some point or another. But there’s actually no way to
        “clear” your mind—you can’t wipe your whiteboard clean and keep it that way. It’s impossible. As soon as
        the ink fades on one thing, it’s replaced by something else.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The question
        is</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.
        what?</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>What’s on Your Whiteboard?</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Let’s do a quick whiteboard assessment. You
        don’t need anything for this but a pen, paper, and this book.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Here’s your task. Think of someplace you visit
        regularly—a grocery store, your workplace, your child’s school—that’s about a fifteen-minute journey
        from your home. Picture it in your mind. Now, I want you to relive the path from your front door to this
        destination and count the number of times you have to turn. Doesn’t matter if you walk, take a car, bus,
        subway, whatever—just try to accurately count the number of turns. If you lose track, no big deal, just
        start over.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>If and when you do get distracted, take a
        minute to jot down what distracted you. If your phone buzzed because you got a text, email, or Twitter
        alert, write </span><span class="calibre4">phone.</span><span> If an anxious thought popped up about a
        meeting you have later, write </span><span class="calibre4">meeting.</span><span> If you find yourself
        thinking about the same distraction more than once, note the repetition. You may have had thoughts about
        the place you are journeying to (in your mind). Try to be as accurate as possible in getting the turn
        count, and as precise as possible in noting what got in the way of doing this. Don’t skimp or skip over
        stuff—ideally, we want a lot of data here.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Remember that distraction can be </span><span
        class="calibre4">good</span><span> stuff. It doesn’t have to be negative to qualify as mind-wandering.
        Your thoughts may shift back to something pleasant that happened this morning (</span><span class="calibre4">the
        stranger ahead of me in line bought my coffee; what a kind gesture!</span><span>)
        or something you’re looking forward to (</span><span class="calibre4">three-day weekend coming
        up!</span><span>). No matter the category—positive vs. negative, productive to-do vs. unproductive
        rumination—simply jot it down.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>This activity is similar to a mental activity
        I asked you to do in the </span><a href="#epubfile5" style="text-decoration:none"><span
          class="calibre1">introduction</span></a><span> when I had you note the number of times your
        flashlight drifted from the page. In this case, you’re noticing not only the </span><span
        class="calibre4">frequency</span><span> of your distraction, but also </span><span
        class="calibre4">what</span><span> was distracting you.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Now let’s assess. What did you find yourself
        thinking about, over and over? Reading your list, you might notice that certain topics are “sticky,”
        that they pop up repeatedly. You might have been fantasizing about the delicious lunch you’re about to
        have or ruminating on an awkward comment you made at a gathering last weekend that you still feel
        embarrassed about. I have no idea. But I’m willing to bet that the vast majority, </span><span
        class="calibre4">if not all</span><span>, of the stuff on your chart isn’t actually an external
        distraction like a phone call or a knock at the door. If you’re like most of us, the biggest distraction
        culprit is actually </span><span class="calibre4">your own mind.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We tend to think of distractions as
        external—the buzz of a phone, the </span><span class="calibre4">bing</span><span> of an email, a ringing
        doorbell, a colleague’s voice interrupting your thought process. More often than not, the most
        irresistible distractions are </span><span class="calibre4">internally</span><span> generated. In the
      </span><a href="#epubfile9" style="text-decoration:none"><span class="calibre1">previous
          chapter</span></a><span>, we talked about finding your focus in a world of distractions, which means
        noticing when your flashlight has strayed and how to quickly and smoothly move it back where you want
        it. This is an essential first step in training your attention. But one thing you’re going to notice as
        you start paying attention to your attention is that even if you manage to eliminate potential external
        distractors (by silencing your phone, pausing your in-box, locking yourself in a quiet room—whatever it
        takes!), there’s still always </span><span class="calibre4">something</span><span> popping up: a worry,
        a regret, a desire, a plan.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Where on earth do these thoughts come from?
        And why do they appear, unbidden, in our working memory, when we want to be using it for something
        else?</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>Where Do Distracting Thoughts Come From?</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Around two decades ago, those of us working in
        the field of neuroscience pondered a mystery: A new and powerful technology—functional MRI (fMRI)—had
        just been invented, and a strange new pattern of brain activity was visualized for the first time. It
        didn’t match any of the brain networks we already knew about—so what was it? The question lingered for
        years.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The new technology was thrilling for
        neuroscientists. We were able to see signals tied to brain activity while a research volunteer was
        actively doing things in the scanner, and we were able to track exactly </span><span
        class="calibre4">where</span><span> the action was happening. What we wanted to do most urgently was
        gather information about the brain regions that were activated during attentionally demanding tasks. In
        other words: Which parts of your brain “light up” when you pay attention in certain ways, and what does
        that tell us about how your attention system works? To do this, we needed to be able to compare the “at
        work” brain to the “at rest” brain.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>First, we looked at the brain doing something
        demanding for attention and working memory, like the “3-back” working memory task: while in the scanner,
        you watch a screen as numbers go by one-by-one, and for each number you answer the question “Was it the
        same as the number you saw three slides back? Or not?” This is a tough one! It gives us a great snapshot
        of working memory </span><span class="calibre4">at work.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Then, we needed an image of the brain
      </span><span class="calibre4">at rest</span><span> to compare it to. “Just rest,” we told our study
        participants. No test, no task, nothing attentionally demanding to puzzle out.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>As expected, </span><a
        name="epubbookmark108"></a><span>certain prefrontal brain regions were much more active when
        participants were doing the 3-back task. In study after study, however, something odd kept happening
        when the participants were “at rest.” A different network came online—a new combination of regions
        activated at the same time. Regions having to do with memory, planning, and emotion all came online
        together. We hadn’t seen this before, and we couldn’t immediately identify what it was. </span><span
        class="calibre4">Why would these regions get activated together during rest?</span><span> They even
        appeared to be yoked, so that their activity waxed and waned together.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We tried giving participants different,
        more-specific instructions, but it didn’t matter what they did—when they were told to rest, we got a
        very specific activation profile in the middle of the brain (called the midline—think of the part of
        your brain that would be under the skull if you parted your hair right down the middle of your scalp).
        Every time we said “rest,” this mystery network booted up.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>So we started asking people as they came out
        of the scanner: </span><span class="calibre4">What did you think about during the rest period?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Their answers:</span></p>
    <p class="num1p" style="margin-top:12pt; margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“I thought about
        lunch.”</span></p>
    <p class="num1p" style="margin-top:12pt; margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“I thought about how
        uncomfortable I was.”</span></p>
    <p class="num1p" style="margin-top:12pt; margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“I thought about a fight I had
        with my roommate this morning.”</span></p>
    <p class="num1p" style="margin-top:12pt; margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“I thought about how I need to
        get a haircut.”</span></p>
    <p class="inparat" style="margin-top:12pt; margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The more participants we
        polled, the more we started to notice a pattern in their responses: they were all self-related topics.
        People weren’t in the scanner thinking about world peace or politics—instead, they were turning inward,
        reflecting on recent episodes in their lives, making plans, analyzing their own feelings, thoughts, and
        sensations.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>This led some research teams to try a twist.
      </span><a name="epubbookmark109"></a><span>They showed participants a series of adjectives while they were
        in the scanner: </span><span class="calibre4">Tall. Funny. Smart. Attractive. Interesting. Friendly.
        Sad. Brave. Likable.</span><span> The instruction: rate how much each word described Bill Clinton (he
        was president at the time) on a scale from “not at all” to “quite a lot.” Then: “Rate how much this word
        describes </span><span class="calibre4">you.</span><span>” And boom, there it was again: the very same,
        unidentified network we’d seen during rest. As soon as participants were asked about themselves rather
        than the president, that same pattern of midline brain regions came online.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The researchers realized something: perhaps
        rest was never actually </span><span class="calibre4">restful.</span><span> Asked to “rest,” the
        participants were instead defaulting to thinking about themselves. A new, somewhat playful acronym
        emerged and was jokingly used among brain researchers: Rapid Ever-present Self-related Thinking, or
      </span><span class="calibre4">R.E.S.T.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Neuroscientists now call this once-mysterious
        network the </span><a name="epubbookmark110"></a><span>“default mode network,” because the brain is
        thought to default to this mode whenever it isn’t otherwise occupied with attentionally demanding tasks
        (and, as we’ll see here shortly, often even when it </span><span class="calibre4">is</span><span>
        occupied). Once we were able to isolate and identify the network, we started to see its fingerprint in
        all sorts of situations. When you’re mind-wandering, the default mode is active. When you’re performing
        a task and making errors—again, you’re in the default mode. Many labs tested this and saw it
        consistently: when people got questions right, </span><a name="epubbookmark111"></a><span>the attention
        network was “online”; when they got stuff wrong, the default mode network was active instead.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>What all this tells us is that when
        mind-wandering directs both your attention and your working memory </span><span
        class="calibre4">inward,</span><span> your default mode is activated. Even in the absence of external
        distractions, your brain will produce its own salient, self-related content. And these internal
        distractions are just as “loud” as external distractions—</span><a name="epubbookmark112"></a><span>emotionally
        charged thoughts can capture attention just as powerfully
        as someone shouting your name.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>This might not be such a problem when you
        don’t need your working memory for something else—as we discussed in the </span><a href="#epubfile9"
        style="text-decoration:none"><span class="calibre1">previous chapter</span></a><span>, allowing space
        for spontaneous thought can be great. The problem is, this is happening all the time. And often you
      </span><span class="calibre4">do</span><span> need your working memory for something else. You need it for
        almost </span><span class="calibre4">everything.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>You Don’t Work Without Working Memory</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Using your working memory is how you learn and
        remember. It’s a “portal” into more permanent storage: you need it to be able to </span><span
        class="calibre4">encode</span><span> information—an experience, new information, and much more—into your
        long-term memory. And when you want to get something </span><span class="calibre4">out</span><span> of
        long-term memory (retrieval), your working memory is where that information is “downloaded” for fast
        access so that you can use it.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><a name="epubbookmark113"></a><span>Working memory
        is critical for social connection and communication. It’s where you track and analyze the intentions and
        actions of other people and hold those observations in mind so that you can navigate social dynamics,
        like waiting your turn in conversation or listening even while you have something to say.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><a name="epubbookmark114"></a><span>And it’s where
        you experience emotion. When you recall a happy memory or something sad or upsetting, you’re using your
        working memory to do so. You essentially “fill up” your whiteboard with the thoughts, feelings, and
        sensations associated with that memory as you construct a full, rich, emotional experience. Working
        memory is deeply connected to your capacity to feel.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>It goes the other way, too: you need working
        memory to </span><span class="calibre4">regulate</span><span> emotions as they come along. Example:
        You’re overcome by some feeling, and you need to get steady. What do you do? You think through the
        problem, or you distract yourself by focusing on some other topic, or you reframe the situation
        (</span><span class="calibre4">maybe it’s not as bad as I think</span><span class="calibre4">&#xa0;</span><span
        class="calibre4">.</span><span class="calibre4">&#xa0;</span><span class="calibre4">.</span><span
        class="calibre4">&#xa0;</span><span class="calibre4">.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>). All these tactics
        require the use of your working
        memory.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><a name="epubbookmark115"></a><span>One study had
        participants come in and watch a disturbing movie. The only catch was that they were instructed to limit
        any overt expression of emotions while doing so. No shouting, crying, or facial expressions were
        allowed. Separately, researchers tested each participant’s working memory capacity by asking them to
        remember letters in between completing simple math problems. Then they looked for a link: Was there any
        correspondence between people’s success at suppressing their expression of emotion and their working
        memory capacity?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span class="calibre4">Yes.</span><span> People who
        had </span><span class="calibre4">low</span><span> working memory capacity were expressing all over the
        place. They truly weren’t able to control it, even though it was the one task they were given.
        Meanwhile, those who had </span><span class="calibre4">higher</span><span> working memory capacity were
        much better at modulating their responses. They may have been using working memory to keep the goal in
        mind (“My job right now is </span><span class="calibre4">not</span><span> to react”) more strongly than
        those with low working memory, or perhaps they were </span><span class="calibre4">reappraising</span><span> the
        situation to shift their response (“It’s just a movie;
        it’s not real”)—whatever their specific tactic was, the key was that they had the </span><span
        class="calibre4">cognitive capacity</span><span> to do it.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Finally, and critically, working memory plays
        a role in every single thing you </span><span class="calibre4">want</span><span> to do, every day, from

        course of a day: anything you set out to do. Deciding to read a book, shopping for dinner supplies,
        thinking about your favorite memes, making your presentation slides, learning how to use a new gadget,
        waiting for traffic to clear before crossing the street. You lean on your working memory to maintain

        kids.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Sophie, our daughter, asked us all to play a
        card game called “Egyptian Slap.” The rules go like this: players take turns rapidly playing a card from
        their hand, and when specific sequences of cards appear, you slap the pile and win the hand. The
        sequences you’re looking for are things like: a </span><span class="calibre4">sandwich</span><span>
        (8–2–8), three of a kind (8–8-8), ordinal (7–8–9), and so on. The kids loved this game—Michael and I
        kind of hated it. There are </span><span class="calibre4">so many rules</span><span>. And you have to
        maintain constant access to them in order to win. You have to hold all these rules actively in working
        memory and take quick action in the moment.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Surprise, surprise, the kids wiped the floor
        with us. A couple of forty-something parents were no match for the lightning-fast mental and physical
        reflexes of our teenage offspring. Our kids, baffled by how poorly we were doing, kept trying to correct
        us. “No, no,” they would say, “you have to slap as </span><span class="calibre4">fast</span><span> as
        you can.” Adorably, they didn’t realize that it wasn’t that we didn’t understand the rules, but that
        while their young </span><a name="epubbookmark116"></a><span>frontal lobes were springing forward, en
        route to actualizing their full potential, ours were falling back, sadly on the decline. But it was
        interesting—as I was playing (and losing), it struck me that the game was the perfect example of a
      </span><span class="calibre4">pure working memory task</span><span>: we had to hold a goal in mind, and then
        take action based on that goal. That’s how working memory works, and also why it impacts you so
        profoundly.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Working memory is the essential partner to
        attention: it’s what allows you to actually </span><span class="calibre4">do</span><span> something with
        the information your flashlight focuses on. But if attention keeps piping in salient and distracting
        content, that will become a big problem for goal maintenance, let alone goal accomplishment. Why?
        Because you only have so much space to work with. Just like a real-life whiteboard, your working memory
        has limits.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>Working Memory Is Limited</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>In the lab, we regularly run experiments that
        try to push the upper limits of working memory. We wanted to know: If working memory was so critical for
        every facet of our lives, exactly how much “space” do we possess in which to do all this important
        work?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We had participants come into the lab and look
        at an image of a face. We made it unremarkable—no unusual or striking features that would make it
        especially memorable. Then the face would disappear for three seconds, before being replaced by another
        face. Their job was to mentally compare the two faces and tell us if they were the same or different.
        Easy! So then, we increased the number of faces people had to hold in mind, to two, then three, then
        four, five, up to nine. It’s a basic way to test working memory’s capacity to maintain information:
        During those three seconds when those first faces are no longer available, the participants have to hold
        those images in working memory—that is, “draw” them over and over on that whiteboard. And when they
        start to answer incorrectly, we know they’re reaching the upper limit of how much their whiteboard can
        hold.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>So, how many faces can people remember before
        they “max out” their working memory? Take a guess. Five? Ten? More?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The answer is </span><span
        class="calibre4">three.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Every time we did this experiment in the lab,
        people got worse with more and more faces. After three, their performance was no better than making a
        complete guess. They performed as poorly as they would have if they had never seen the faces in the
        first place.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“Well,” you might say, “faces are
        complicated—they have so many little details!” But it turns out that three or four items are about the
        limit that can be held in working memory, even with very simple stimuli like colored shapes. Why? Well,
        one possibility is that each item you hold in working memory has a unique brain frequency signature—like
        a radio channel. </span><a name="epubbookmark117"></a><span>And you can “open” three or four of those
        channels at once and still keep them separate from each other. But if you try to go past four, they
        start to scramble, or become “disambiguated.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The reason that local phone numbers have seven
        digits is actually directly related to the “size” of working memory: In 1956, a psychologist named
        George Miller published a paper on working memory titled </span><a name="epubbookmark118"></a><span>“The
        Magical Number Seven, Plus or Minus Two.” He’d found that seven (plus or minus two) was the sweet spot
        for memorizing a string of numbers—it was the upper limit of what most people could briefly hold or
        easily memorize, because </span><a name="epubbookmark119"></a><span>the time it takes to say seven
        numbers in English is roughly the “time buffer” of our auditory working memory. Even a couple of seconds
        longer means that those numbers are already fading too fast for you to dial. (And if you remember rotary
        phones, you know how important this was at the time!)</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>You can use several strategies to assist you,
        now that you’re empowered with the knowledge that your working memory is limited. For example, recall
        the journalist who had called to interview me. </span><a name="epubbookmark120"></a><span>“Cognitive
        offloading” is what he utilized when he asked me if he could write down his thoughts at the beginning of
        our interview. Cognitive offloading is a great tactic—it’s beneficial for task performance. Yet it
        doesn’t address one of our core problems: </span><span class="calibre4">we don’t always realize that we
        are overloaded.</span><span> We aren’t aware, moment to moment, of all that is on our whiteboard, and we
        don’t get clued in until we experience a failure.</span></p>

    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The first story in this chapter is the perfect
        example of a common type of working memory failure: </span><span class="calibre4">overload</span><span>.
        You’re trying to hang onto too much, and you push your working memory past its limits. You might also
        experience </span><a name="epubbookmark121"></a><span>the opposite: </span><span

    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span class="calibre4">I just had it!</span><span>
        you think as you walk into a room and have no idea why you’re there. Or you’ve been called on to speak
        after sitting in class or in a meeting with your hand up, only to turn to your own mind, which moments
        ago had a brilliant, fully written speech, to find an empty white page. Why does this happen? The field
        of neuroscience suggests a few ideas. One is that we mind-wander with no
        awareness</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.
        the flashlight gets pulled away, whatever we were maintaining vanishes, and we return to a “blank”
        whiteboard. </span><a name="epubbookmark122"></a><span>Another hypothesis is that there is a “sudden
        death” of neural activity for the information we were trying to hang onto: a whole symphony of brain
        activity is happening, and then all of it stops at the same time. You may have a sense that something
        was there, but now it’s gone.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>And finally: </span><span
        class="calibre4">distraction.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>You’ve learned by now how powerful salient
        distractors can be. Anything especially salient, or “loud” (literally or metaphorically), will
        definitely capture your attention, whether it’s in your external environment (producing sights, sounds,
        or other sensations) or in your mindscape (thoughts, memories, emotions). One of the ramifications of
        this is that once the “loud” thing lands in your working memory, it may write over what you were trying
        to hang onto. Result: whatever previous content you were in the process of either </span><span
        class="calibre4">maintaining</span><span> (keeping the traces active for use) or </span><span
        class="calibre4">encoding</span><span> (“writing” more permanently into long-term memory) is disrupted.

    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><a name="epubbookmark124"></a><span>In 2013, our lab
        collaborated on a large-scale study with schoolteachers from around the United States and Canada to see
        whether mindfulness training would have any impact on cognitive performance and burnout, a particular
        concern for educators. The training was an eight-week mindfulness course taught by a qualified trainer.
        In addition to attending the class meetings, they had to do mindfulness homework exercises between
        classes. The teachers were all given a classic experiment to index their working memory capacity:
        Remember a short sequence of letters, say, M Z B. Then they were asked to do a simple math problem. We’d
        add another letter to the sequence, then give them another computation; then add another letter, assign
        another problem. We wanted to know this: How long of a string of letters could they remember accurately
        before their working memory started to fade and ultimately fail, all the while maintaining their ability
        to give correct answers to the math problems?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Half the group then participated in an
        eight-week mindfulness course, while the other half waited for their turn to take the course. (That’s an
        important way to control for a potential study contaminant: differing motivation. Instead of having a
        control group that simply receives nothing or has no interest in receiving training, a wait-list control
        group, at least in theory, has a similar level of motivation and investment during the testing sessions,
        because eventually they too will get the training.) When we retested both groups after the first group
        finished their training, we found that those who’d already done their eight-week mindfulness course
        showed better working memory than the group that was still waiting.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>These intriguing results led us to our next
        burning question: </span><span class="calibre4">How</span><span> was mindfulness training improving
        working memory? My hunch: It helped declutter the mental whiteboard.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><a name="epubbookmark125"></a><span>Colleagues at
        the University of California, Santa Barbara, had the same hunch and tested it out in a clever
        experiment. They gave forty-eight undergraduate students the same working memory task we had provided
        teachers and those Marines we studied in West Palm Beach years before, but they added one important
        twist. After the experiment was over, they asked participants to report how often they were
        mind-wandering—were they having off-task thoughts often or not so often during the experiment?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>After doing the working memory study, half of
        them were invited to receive mindfulness training for two weeks and the other half got nutrition
        education as “comparison training.” They found that only mindfulness training improved working memory in
        these students, and it was most helpful to those who mind-wandered a lot before their training. This
        study also asked a practical question: Does improving working memory and reducing mind-wandering help
        students on academic tasks? The answer: Yes! Students who got the mindfulness training improved an
        average of sixteen percentile points on the reading comprehension section of the Graduate Record Exam
        (GRE), an important test for gaining entry into graduate programs.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Let’s sum up and connect the dots: In
        high-stress groups, like teachers experiencing burnout, stress is kryptonite for attention—mental time
        travel is one of the main culprits. Instead of being able to keep your flashlight aimed where you need
        it, you’re either in rewind (ruminating, regretting) or in fast-forward (catastrophizing or
        worrying</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.
        often about something imagined that may never come to pass). Working memory (your mental whiteboard)
        relies on this vary same attentional flashlight to encode and refresh its contents. But if
        stress-related mental time travel hijacks attention away, working memory gets filled up with irrelevant
        input. Any processes that rely on working memory will suffer as well. This means comprehension,
        planning, thinking, decision making, and experiencing and regulating emotions all become
        compromised.</span></p>

    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>One Friday night, after a very long week of
        teaching, meetings, and deadlines, I told my husband, Michael, that I had really maxed out my
        decision-making powers. I asked if I could offload to him all decisions regarding our evening plans, but
        I had one request and one condition. The request: that we do something fun that would be “transportive”
        and entertaining. The condition: “I am not leaving this couch.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>He announced that we would be streaming a show
        called </span><span class="calibre4">Lucifer.</span><span> It’s a show about the Devil, who, bored with
        being in Hell, moves to Los Angeles (where else?) to become a nightclub owner. (I rolled my eyes in
        protest, but he pushed </span><span class="calibre4">play.</span><span> “You asked me to make the
        decisions!” he reminded me. Fair enough!) Lucifer partners up with a cop and dedicates himself to
        punishing people when they choose to use their free will to do bad things. And when they die? You
        guessed it—they get sent to Hell. And then the show started to elaborate on its version of Hell:
        basically, Lucifer was putting people in circumstances where they had to play out their biggest
        regret—the same time loop, over and over again. And I thought, </span><span class="calibre4">Ha! That’s
        rumination!</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><a name="epubbookmark126"></a><span>Rumination is
        one of the most potent forms of mental time travel. It involves getting stuck thinking about the same
        thing over and over. When we ruminate on something, we get caught in a loop: we go over events, wishing
        they could have gone differently; sometimes we imagine the alternate ways things might have gone, or we
        remember how they </span><span class="calibre4">actually</span><span> went, and we end up going over
        those events yet again. We can also ruminate by catastrophizing: imagining how events might unfold in
        the future, worrying about various potentialities that may never come to pass. These types of mental
        loops are magnetic—they become conflict states, and it’s very hard to pull our flashlights away from
        them. When we do manage to, we tend to return immediately to the topic as soon as possible, like a
        tongue seeking a sore tooth.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>It was kind of funny, to me, discovering that
        rumination is so terrible that somebody made a whole show about how it’s </span><span class="calibre4">literally

    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Mental time travel diminishes our working
        memory’s ability to do the work needed for the demands of our present moment. And because when we’re
        mentally writing and rewriting things over and over again, regardless of what we’re looping on, it
        leaves no room for anything else. We don’t have capacity available for either cognition or emotional
        regulation. You might find yourself, in this situation, making a hasty decision or snapping at your
        kids. Stress levels go up, mood goes down. That self-assisted stress wears on our attention, making it
        even more difficult to resist what I call the “loop of doom.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Whatever the contents of our working memory,

        goal-focused, occupied and engaged in content aligned with both what you want to be doing and what
        you’re actually doing, as in some external task. You’re focused, engaged, responsive. You’re noticing
        everything, from sensory details to the larger context of your experience—all the “information” about
        your surroundings and immediate environment that you need to accomplish your task is available to

        instead of on that couch with your child. You may even experience </span><span class="calibre4">perceptual
        decoupling</span><span>, where your flashlight is so focused on your
        whiteboard content that you aren’t even able to process sensory input from your surroundings. (That, for
        the record, is how we get ourselves into situations where we’ve read a book a hundred times, and still
        don’t know what a wump is.)</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Here’s how strong this effect is: if you’re
        holding something in working memory, </span><span class="calibre4">your brain’s computational resources
        shift to service that content.</span><span> This is what we call the </span><span
        class="calibre4">biasing</span><span> effect of working memory. In one experiment, we wanted to figure
        out the power of working memory’s biasing effect on perception. How “strongly” does it influence
      </span><span class="calibre4">what you perceive?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We ran an experiment similar to the one I
        described earlier that told us the upper limits of working memory. </span><a
        name="epubbookmark127"></a><span>But this time, we put the brain cap on our participants while they did
        the experiment, and we only gave them one face to remember. What we found: when you’re maintaining a
        face in your working memory, during those three seconds when there’s no face on the screen, your
        face-processing neurons </span><span class="calibre4">stay active.</span><span> How did we know this?
        During the delay, we presented a small gray “probe” image—a sort of shapeless blob—which we made by
        taking all the pixels of the face image and randomly moving them around. We were intrigued to see a
        stronger N170 (the brainwave response generated when seeing a face) to these probes when participants
        were remembering faces than when they were remembering anything else (like scenes).</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Let’s break that down. Why was this an
        intriguing finding for us? Well, it told us that working memory performs the same type of “top-down”
        biasing that your attention system does: everything your brain does now becomes calibrated to what’s on
        your whiteboard. It isn’t just that it </span><span class="calibre4">seems</span><span> as if you’re
        experiencing whatever you’re thinking about instead of what’s right in front of you. It’s that neurally,
        that’s exactly what’s happening. Your brain is perceiving a face </span><span
        class="calibre4">internally</span><span>, even as your eyes are staring at a gray blob.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>So: if you’re reading about wumps on the
        couch, or driving across a long bridge in Florida, or sitting at the judge’s bench while a defense
        attorney gives closing arguments, and your thoughts are elsewhere, then—as far as your brain knows—you
      </span><span class="calibre4">are</span><span> elsewhere</span><span class="calibre4">.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Now, I want to take a minute here to make an
        important point. Everything we’ve been talking about so far regarding your working memory—its temporary
        nature, its susceptibility to threat and stress, and the way it can be hijacked by mind-wandering—all
        probably sounds like a litany of negatives. As if working memory is programmed solely for failure.
        Meanwhile, I’m telling you how important it is for all you want to accomplish. So, what gives? If this
        is such a critical brain capacity, why on earth would Mother Nature leave us with such a faulty,
        error-prone tool? Why are there so many “bugs” in this software?</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead1" style="margin:20.25pt 5pt 10.8pt"><span>It’s a </span><span
        class="calibre6">Feature</span><span>, Not a Bug</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>My answer to that is: It’s not a bug. It’s a
        feature. Each of these apparent flaws has a purpose. Let’s take a look.</span></p>
    <p class="leftparats" style="margin-top:18pt; margin-right:5pt; margin-left:23pt"><span
        class="calibre4">Disappearing ink</span></p>
    <p class="leftpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:23pt"><span>If this fast-fading ink on our whiteboards
        is such a problem, why didn’t we evolve to have ink that stuck around longer? Something more
        permanent?</span></p>
    <p class="inparats" style="margin-top:18pt; margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Imagine what it would be
        like if your whiteboard didn’t auto-clear every few seconds. Every passing thought, everything that
        caught your attention, every little intrusion or distraction would stick around. Even helpful stuff
        would turn into a burden. Forget maintaining goals or problem solving—you’d be overburdened by the
        weight and stagnation of any arising mental content. It would be hard to tell the difference between
        what is important or not, since no matter what, content would just stick around in your conscious mind,
        for longer than you might need it. Your working memory </span><span class="calibre4">had</span><span> to
        evolve to be fleeting. Your brain needs to automatically dump content at a rapid, constant pace, so that
        there is flexibility and choice in what you continue to focus on and, therefore, maintain.</span></p>

    <p class="inparats" style="margin-top:18pt; margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Let’s bring back our
        helpful assistant, your long-ago ancestor, to help us out with this one. Picture him in the forest. He
        has a goal he’s holding in working memory: </span><span class="calibre4">find food.</span><span> He’s
        scanning for the red pop of a particular berry that grows in this area—all his brain functions are now
        calibrated to achieving that goal. As he scans for </span><span class="calibre4">red</span><span>, his
        color-processing neurons are sizzling, active and ready. Then, he spots it: motion in the trees. Tiger.
        Working memory dumps the previous goal as fast as he could snap his fingers, and a new directive
        appears: </span><span class="calibre4">freeze.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We still need this feature—though it can get
        us into trouble when we misperceive or imagine </span><span class="calibre4">threat</span><span>. We
        need to be able to </span><span class="calibre4">rapidly</span><span> act without a sluggish delay. And
        this feature allows us to perform this crucial, and sometimes lifesaving, pivot.</span></p>

        class="calibre4">Capacity</span></p>
    <p class="leftpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:23pt"><span>But why are we so limited? Why can we only
        remember three things, instead of three hundred?</span></p>
    <p class="inparats" style="margin-top:18pt; margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>To be honest, we are still
        puzzling this one out, and frequency-based brain dynamics are likely to give us an answer. One
        explanation may be this: even if you </span><span class="calibre4">could</span><span> remember a million
        things, a big reason for having working memory, like attention, is to </span><span class="calibre4">be
        able to take action</span><span>, and you still only have two hands and two feet.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>These features of working memory evolved so
        that we don’t remember everything and thereby become unresponsive to changing demands. They served our
        ancestors well thousands of years ago, and they continue to serve us well today, even in our mostly
        tiger-free world. It’s just that these evolutionarily selected features come with their downsides. On
        the upside, though, we are learning rapidly, with more and more research studies suggesting that
        mindfulness training can help. With training, we can still have a peak mind—even with these
        tendencies.</span></p>

    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I used to think mindfulness was about hitting
        the “pause” button, which to me always felt artificial or idealistic. Life has no </span><span

        attention and developing a peak mind, what we’re actually looking for is a </span><span

        first core practice, </span><span class="calibre4">Find Your Flashlight.</span><span> Now we’re going to
        try a variation on that practice that helps pull us out of the loop of doom. It works because you must
        step outside your journey going around and around in those ruminative loops of doom to make a category
        judgment about the contents of your mind-wandering. And then, after labeling the content of your
        mind-wandering, you return back to the present moment. When you </span><span class="calibre4">do</span><span>
        get sucked into ruminative mind-wandering (which happens to the best of
        us), you start to recognize what’s happening—and as you practice more, you recognize it </span><span
        class="calibre4">sooner.</span><span> You’re not replaying an argument with a friend for the tenth time
        before you notice that you’ve been using your whiteboard for something else while you’re trying to
        listen to your colleague talk to you. As you train yourself to monitor what’s happening in the present
        moment, you’ll default less and less to long, unproductive, and off-task bouts of mental time travel.
        You’ll get better at noticing mind-wandering and asking: What are the contents of my working memory
        right now, and are they supporting me for what is needed right now? Or would shifting back to the
        present moment be best? If so, redirect your attention back to the sights, sounds, and demands of the
        present moment.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>This is another “variation” of classical

        suggesting that the contents of your whiteboard should </span><span class="calibre4">always</span><span>
        match the contents of your immediate task-at-hand. Like the fallacy of having a “perfect unbroken
        focus,” that’s neither possible nor desirable. There’s nothing inherently bad about having stuff on your
        whiteboard other than what’s right in front of your nose. It’s neither bad nor good—it’s simply
      </span><span class="calibre4">how the brain works.</span><span> It happens. Spontaneous thought arises. We
        use working memory to work something out that has nothing to do with the present moment—puzzle out a
        logistical problem, figure out how we feel about something, or make a plan or a decision. There are
        plenty of situations where it’s absolutely best to have the content of the whiteboard be information
        about the past or future—and in those moments, the present moment becomes enriched with the content that
        time traveling provides access to.</span></p>

        well might be a moment when you </span><span class="calibre4">do</span><span> need your working memory
        for a current demand. And this is not just about some on-the-job type of performance—there are all kinds
        of reasons you don’t want to be disconnected from your environment, like connection to others, learning,

        trapped at all. All the doors were unlocked. They could choose to leave at any time. They simply didn’t,
        because they assumed they couldn’t.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Ultimately, having a strong working memory is
        not about always using it for your goals and plans, every minute; or about always being in the present
        moment—this is neither realistic nor desirable. Instead, it’s about becoming aware of what your working
        memory actually contains. It’s about recognizing and heading off any interference (such as mental time
        travel) when there is a task to be done. It can even be about basking in the “nowness” of a refreshing
        morning shower. In the lab, we find that people who display better performance are better able to
      </span><span class="calibre4">drop the distractions.</span><span> </span><a name="epubbookmark129"></a><span>They
        are able to allow the ink to fade when it’s appropriate for it to

    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>This is where the </span><span
        class="calibre4">new</span><span> science of attention has moved us forward in our understanding of how
        to reclaim this critical cognitive workspace. We have long understood the connections between working
        memory and attention, and between working memory and long-term memory. What we’re understanding now is
        that working memory is far more than just a “holding cell” for information.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>What’s in your working memory will—as we’ll

        way to use the “flashlight beam” of our attention, but one that we are beginning to realize is critical

    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>However, you cannot just “decide” to be aware
        of what’s on your whiteboard, moment to moment—as with any kind of training, you have to build up to
        that capacity. And this is why, at a certain point in my research, I had to push forward with exploring

        showed us that with mindfulness training, plus a commitment to daily practice, people under long-term,
        high-stress conditions could indeed keep their attention and working memory intact and have cognitive
        resilience. They could be trained to protect their attention and working memory from the damaging
        stressors surrounding them. It was a promising study, but small—too small. We needed a bigger sample
        group, and a more-honed experiment. I wanted to find out more about what type of mental training,
        specifically, worked best, and the “dosage” level required to make a real difference for someone
        operating under high-stress conditions.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Professionally, I was warned against pursuing

        closed. It seemed we were asking for too much: we were asking for </span><span
        class="calibre4">time</span><span>, and a lot of it. This study had a brainwave component, and the setup
        for the electrode cap alone took one hour! And we were asking for their time during the worst-possible
        period: predeployment, when soldiers train for some of the most intense and high-stakes conditions they
        will ever experience. But that was exactly when I needed them—during that high-stress interval when
        they’d have to perform at their peak, and then continue to do so as they were deployed. “No,” everybody
        said. “No, no, no.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>And then, after an entire year of asking, a
      </span><span class="calibre4">yes.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>That “yes” came from Walt Piatt, the
        lieutenant general we met in the </span><a href="#epubfile5" style="text-decoration:none"><span
          class="calibre1">introduction</span></a><span>. At the time (more than a decade ago) he was a
        colonel, heading up a US Army brigade based in Hawaii that was in-between deployments. When my team and
        I flew out to meet Colonel Piatt about the study, I was briefed by his executive officer to keep our
        presentation short and to the point, as his time was extremely limited. I walked in ready for him to be
        stereotypically “military”—all business, stiff and stoic with a no-nonsense edge.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Instead, the first thing he did was take us to
        the base’s “remembrance room,” where the service members who didn’t make it back alive were
        memorialized. We walked slowly around the room, looking at the names and boots of the fallen. He talked
        about the challenges of life in the military, before, during, and after deployment. He showed us photos
        of friends he’d lost, including Iraqi friends. And he told me that when he looked over our materials
        describing the study, he thought of something his wife, Cynthia, was always saying to him: “Don’t deploy
        before you deploy.” Through his multiple deployments, she’d noticed that before he had physically gone
        to a war zone halfway around the world, he would already be mentally gone. Immediately I thought of all
        the myriad ways so many of us might “deploy before we deploy,” spending so much time in our heads
        planning and imagining the next upcoming thing that we completely miss our lives in the moment. I
        thought of myself earlier that week: standing on the sidelines at my son’s soccer game, I was mentally
        already at the next day’s faculty meeting. I barely remembered a thing about that game. (It still gets
        me.)</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Driving back to the hotel, I went over the
        experience in my mind—it was not at all what I had expected. The colonel’s decision to take us to the
        remembrance room first was telling. It occurred to me that in Sanskrit the word for </span><span
        class="calibre4">mindfulness</span><span> is </span><span class="calibre4">smriti</span><span>, which
        can be translated as “that which is remembered.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>When we </span><span class="calibre4">stay in
        play—</span><span>when we are filling up our whiteboards with the present moment—we have a much greater
        chance of </span><span class="calibre4">encoding</span><span> that moment into long-term memory. We all
        want to “remember better.” Can mindfulness help us also press the </span><span
        class="calibre4">record</span><span> button?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Yes. But pressing </span><span
        class="calibre4">record</span><span> isn’t quite as straightforward as it may seem.</span></p>

    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The minute Richard walked into our training
        session, I could tell he was a skeptic. A gentle yet tough former active-duty soldier who now worked for
        a military research center, he hung back, quiet and reserved. He was unfailingly polite. But I could see
        it in his eyes—he wasn’t on board, not at all.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>This was a “training for trainers” program
        that my colleague Scott Rogers and I were leading. Richard had been sent by his bosses to learn how to
        deliver mindfulness training to military cohorts. His job in the Research Transition Office at the
        Walter Reed Army Institute of Research was to help adapt new science (like ours, on the attentional
        benefits of mindfulness practice) into training that the US Army could offer soldiers. But he had
        serious doubts. He was deeply concerned that mindfulness would clash with his religious beliefs. His
        Christianity was the bedrock of his life and beliefs, and he worried about the directive from his
        employer to train other soldiers in mindfulness, and to learn it for himself first. Would he be able to
        do his job?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>When he walked into the session that first
        morning, he said he felt on edge. “My mindset was, </span><span class="calibre4">I’m going to find a way
        out of this.</span><span>”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>But as we went through the material, his
        resistance started to melt. There was nothing religious in nature. The mission of mindfulness training,
        and the reasons it worked to strengthen attention, working memory, and mood, made a lot of sense to him.
        The message that soldiers often weren’t able to respond to the demands of the moment because of other
        worries they carried really resonated. He started thinking, </span><span class="calibre4">This could
        really be helpful.</span><span> And he started to wonder: When he prayed—a practice that was deeply
        meaningful to him—was he there, mentally? Was he attending to the prayer? When he was with his kids, who
        were growing up fast, was he actually </span><span class="calibre4">with</span><span> them? His teenage
        children were always trying to share memories with him: “It was so funny
        when</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.”
        “Dad, remember that time
        when</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>?”
        He’d think, </span><span class="calibre4">Oh wow, I don’t remember that at all</span><span>.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>He’d always written it off: </span><span
        class="calibre4">I just have a terrible memory.</span><span> Now he wondered—did he actually have a
        terrible memory, or was it something else? Every time his kids tried to connect with him over a shared
        experience, he felt a pang.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“I realized that I couldn’t be part of those
        memories with them because I wasn’t part of the moment to begin with. I was in another place, all the
        time.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Even though he’d been physically present for
        these events (he had the pictures to prove it), he hadn’t actually experienced them. Busy, pressured,
        and driven, he felt that his attention was forever elsewhere, no matter what he was doing, no matter
        whom he was with.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“I wasn’t there,” he says now, “so I didn’t
        remember it.”</span></p>
    <p class="nonparats" style="margin-top:24pt; margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span
        class="calibre4">Memory</span><span> can be tricky. We assume that we’ll remember much more than we do.
        Then we run up against a moment like the one Richard experienced with his children, and we wonder how
        much of our lives we are fully taking in. What have we failed to record? Important moments with loved
        ones, essential knowledge—or more? You might make a mistake because something you do know doesn’t
        surface in the moment you need it; you have a frustrating, fuzzy sense of </span><span class="calibre4">I should
        know that.</span><span> You want to listen and remember the content of an
        important meeting or a lovely moment with your family; meanwhile you’re going over a regrettable
        incident from your past, something that’s already </span><span class="calibre4">in</span><span> your
        long-term memory that you’d rather forget.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>It’s easy to wonder if there’s something wrong
        with your memory—why experiences and learning seem to slip off instead of sink into your long-term
        storage. Yet for every single one of those examples—why some memories stick and others don’t, why
        knowledge surfaces when you need it sometimes but not at other times—there’s an explanation. And it
        probably doesn’t have much to do with your actual memory</span><span class="calibre4">.</span><span>

    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>When I popped open my camera roll just now and
        scrolled back through time, the first event that grabbed my attention was the last family dinner we had
        before Leo left for college—he was all grown up and heading out into the world, and I’d wanted all four
        of us together at the table for one last special meal. Looking at the photo, I vividly remember trying
        to get the angle just right, for everybody to be smiling and looking at the camera. But I don’t remember

    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>It’s tempting to think of memory as the
        brain’s </span><span class="calibre4">record</span><span> button. And indeed, I’ve been using the “press
        record” concept as a metaphor here for how we remember. But we don’t really
        “record”</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.
        not exactly.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>Memory Isn’t a Recording</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span class="calibre4">Remembering</span><span> is a
        complex, nuanced process. Memories are mutable, not static. Unlike a photo on your camera roll, they
        don’t stay the same every time you pull them up. Memories morph and change. And some things stick in our
        memories while others fall away. Rest assured: there’s probably nothing wrong with your memory.
      </span><span class="calibre4">This is just how memory works.</span><span> Our memory privileges certain
        types of information, and we forget other things completely, by evolutionary design. What you might say
        is “wrong” with your memory probably has an evolutionarily selected purpose.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Your memory is not a verbatim recorder of
        events. Your mind might be a fantastic time traveler, but you can’t “rewind” and relive events exactly
        as they happened—because there is no “exactly as it happened.” What you remember is filtered through
        your </span><span class="calibre4">experience</span><span> of what happened, as well as the experiences
        you had before and after. “Episodic memory,” which is your </span><a name="epubbookmark131"></a><span>memory for
        experiences, involves </span><span class="calibre4">selective encoding of only those aspects of experience that
        were most attended to and
        held in working memory</span><span>. Translation: you’ll only remember what you focused on and “wrote”
        on your whiteboard—not everything that occurred. And further, your episodic memory doesn’t merely
        involve the external aspects of events (who, what, where, and so forth) but is deeply wrapped up in your
        autobiographical take on what you experienced. So—was the experience happy? Sad? Interesting? Tense?
        Your emotional experience will influence what you focus on—and therefore what you remember.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“Semantic memory”—meaning your general world
        knowledge, for facts, ideas, concepts—is similarly selective. What you remember is based on what else
        you’ve previously learned.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Both these types of memory are not only
        inexorably linked with attention, but also a tightening circle: what we pay attention to is what we
        remember, and what we remember will influence what we pay attention to—and therefore what </span><span
        class="calibre4">else</span><span> we remember.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>Why We Have Memory</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>A friend of mine who has little kids mentioned
        her concerns about the kinds of memories her kids are making—specifically, the memories they’re making
        about </span><span class="calibre4">her.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>She described yelling at her son earlier that
        day about something small. This was a few months into the COVID-19 quarantine, and everybody’s nerves
        were getting a little frayed.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“I thought, </span><span class="calibre4">Oh,
        I hope he doesn’t remember this, out of all the good things we did today,</span><span>” she said. “And
        then I started thinking about it and realized that most of my very specific memories of my own mother
        from when I was a kid are the negative ones. I remember very vividly the times she was frustrated, or
        yelled, or when I was in trouble. There’s only a handful of them, but I remember them very specifically,
        every detail. Meanwhile, it’s hard to remember any of the good stuff in much detail. And it was mostly
        good stuff! She spent all day every day taking care of us, setting up art projects, being patient,
        listening to our stories—and all I remember are negative things? Is that what my kids are going to
        remember about me—only the bad stuff?”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>When I responded, I started with the bad news:
      </span><a name="epubbookmark132"></a><span>Yes, we remember negative information better than positive
        information. (Although the </span><span class="calibre4">good news</span><span> is that this bias
      </span><span class="calibre4">does</span><span> fade as we age into our sixties.) Our “record button,” such
        as it is, does not record events comprehensively and with veracity—because the purpose of memory is not
        to allow us to savor the past, but rather to help us </span><span class="calibre4">act</span><span> in
        the world </span><span class="calibre4">now.</span><span> Memory</span><span class="calibre4">,</span><span>
        like attention itself, is a completely biased system that evolved to
        privilege survival. We are always “subsampling” experiences that are important to our survival—that’s
        why scary or stressful experiences are more prominent.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Memory allows us to learn. It provides
        stability and continuity. The things that happen to us that are constant or “normal” tend to fade into
        the background, while </span><a name="epubbookmark133"></a><span>the things that are outliers are more
        privileged—they become more salient in our memory. This feature of memory is once again yoked to
        attention, which privileges novel and outlier events.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Here’s what I told my friend: that her
        negative memories of childhood stood out was, in fact, a great sign. It meant she’d had a happy, stable
        childhood. And the same would probably be true for her own children. Yes, they might remember certain
        episodes more than others. But if the backdrop of their lives is loving and positive, that too is part
        of their memory—specifically their semantic memory. We cannot remember every single episode—such a
        function wouldn’t serve us.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Which is why we forget.</span></p>

    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Long-term memory in most healthy individuals
        has a large capacity, but that also means it’s prone to interference: information you remembered

        information you’re learning </span><span class="calibre4">now</span><span> can mess up what you learned

    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>During the coronavirus pandemic, for a brief

      </span><span class="calibre4">have</span><span> memory is for learning—for guiding us in how to act in the
        present moment and in the future. For that to work, it’s every bit as important that we forget as it is
        that we remember. The mind works the way it does for good reason—we wouldn’t want to fundamentally
        change any of these “features” of memory. And yet there are vulnerabilities within the system, and we do
        run into certain issues because of them.</span></p>

        asked to make no documentation whatsoever. One of the experiences was watching a TED talk, and another
        was a self-guided tour of Stanford University’s Memorial Church in Palo Alto.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>On the topic of enjoyment and engagement, the
        results were mixed. In some situations, participants seemed to really enjoy the experience of curating
        content for others to consume, viewing it as a source of connection and community, so it added to their
        enjoyment of the experience. Meanwhile, others worried about how their post would be perceived, or
        compared themselves to others on social media, detracting from their enjoyment. On the subject of
      </span><span class="calibre4">memory,</span><span> the results were consistent and clear: people who were
        asked to photograph events—either for others on social media, or just for themselves—were much worse at
        remembering details of those events later.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Why? First, documenting something requires
        multitasking—which, as we know, is actually </span><span class="calibre4">task switching.</span><span>
        You’re not taking a picture </span><span class="calibre4">and</span><span> experiencing what you’re
        photographing. You’re taking the picture </span><span class="calibre4">or.</span><span> It’s always a
        choice. When you’re engaged in the task of taking the picture, you cannot simultaneously be focused on
        the activity you’re documenting. This is as true if you’re on vacation someplace gorgeous taking a
        picture (will you remember that sunset?) as it is in a classroom or conference room: </span><a
        name="epubbookmark136"></a><span>studies have found that media use in the classroom (like using only a
        laptop to take notes) is linked with a decrease in academic success. This is partly because students get
        tempted to go online (their chat threads and shopping carts end up full, while their minds stay empty of
        much of the lecture-related content) but also because of the second reason: even when we </span><span
        class="calibre4">are</span><span> actually “paying attention” to what we’re documenting, the way we use
        these devices affects how we process, and therefore remember, these experiences.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>In the case of laptops in classrooms, even
        when students were dutifully typing out notes, they became a kind of typing robot, transcribing like
        Siri. The problem is, they weren’t </span><span class="calibre4">synthesizing</span><span> that
        information. One of the things we do naturally when we take handwritten notes is synthesize—we pay
        attention while listening, then analyze what was said to pull out or summarize the most important
        points. We have to: we simply can’t write fast enough to transcribe every word we hear, so we have to be
        strategic. And when we do this kind of synthesis, we’re better able to encode that information in a
        richer, fuller, more integrated, and consequently more long-lasting way. Note-taking on laptops ends up
        being a great way to get a good transcription of a lecture into your computer, but a really bad way to
        get any of that lecture content into your long-term memory.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Using digital devices like phones and laptops
        to record what we most want to remember ends up having the </span><span class="calibre4">opposite</span><span>
        effect. The social media study’s authors concluded that using
        media hinders us from later recalling the very events we are trying to preserve—because it gets in the
        way of really experiencing the event in the first place. We end up with a photo of something we can’t
        actually remember, or a transcript of a lecture we didn’t really “attend.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Nobody wants to be told to “put down your
        phone.” Yet the study results were clear: people who documented their experiences remembered a lot less.
        It’s simple, and there’s no magical way around it: if an experience doesn’t get on your mental
        whiteboard—where it can be organized and synthesized, where the elements of the experience can be
        integrated together—it doesn’t go into long-term memory. It doesn’t even stand a chance.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>The Portal to Long-Term Memory</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>When I was an undergraduate, I learned about a
        famous patient in neuroscience history, known in the textbooks by the initials “H. M.” In 1953,
      </span><a name="epubbookmark137"></a><span>H. M. received an experimental brain surgery to treat his
        epilepsy. He’d been having seizures since he was ten years old, and by twenty-seven, they were so
        constant and debilitating that he couldn’t work. His doctors had tried higher and higher doses of
        anticonvulsants, but nothing was working, so they took a drastic step: they removed most of H. M.’s
        temporal lobes, where the epileptic “storms” were happening, in an experimental procedure called a
      </span><span class="calibre4">bilateral medial-temporal lobectomy.</span><span> The surgery was a success—H.
        M.’s epileptic episodes declined dramatically. But the temporal lobes contain multiple brain structures
        involved in long-term memory. How much would the surgery affect H. M.’s memory?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>As it turned out, H. M. retained all his
        long-term memories right up to a few years before the surgery. His working memory also appeared
        unscathed—in lab tests, he could hold number sequences in mind for as long as he kept his focus on them,
        just like any of us. When researchers distracted him, however, to briefly divert his attention away from
        whatever he was holding in working memory, it vanished—forever.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>My teaching assistant had actually worked in
        the very lab that ran studies on H. M.’s memory function. One night, she was at the lab working with H.
        M. and had been given the errand of driving him home, back to his apartment at an assisted living
        facility. They were in the car, chatting, when she realized that she had no idea where he lived. H. M.
        began to confidently guide her, and so she followed each instruction as he successfully directed her to
        his
        home</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.
        his </span><span class="calibre4">childhood</span><span> home, on the other side of town.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Until he died in 2008, H. M. was the subject
        of decades of studies on memory and memory formation. Researchers found that his early memories from
        before the surgery were exquisitely vivid, possibly because there were no new memories being formed to
        compete with them. But study after study confirmed that he </span><span class="calibre4">only</span><span> had
        access to working memory—no new long-term memories (for episodes
        or new facts) could be created. What H. M. had lost in the bilateral medial-temporal lobectomy that
        cured his epilepsy was the </span><span class="calibre4">connection</span><span> between working memory
        and long-term memory. H. M. could </span><span class="calibre4">briefly</span><span> hold content on his
        whiteboard, just like anyone, but had no capacity to remember it in a more enduring way.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Your working memory is not only your cognitive
        “scratch space” where you do your creative thinking, ideation, focusing, and goal pursuit. It’s also the
        portal into (and out of!) long-term memory. The stuff you want to remember gets </span><span
        class="calibre4">into</span><span> your long-term memory through working memory, and when we retrieve
        information </span><span class="calibre4">from</span><span> long-term memory, working memory is where it
        appears. To “remember” is in fact </span><span class="calibre4">both</span><span> of these
        functions—</span><span class="calibre4">encode</span><span> and </span><span
        class="calibre4">retrieve</span><span>—packed together: you encode something, and then fish it back up
        later. Each of these processes requires the effective use of </span><span class="calibre4">both</span><span>
        your attention </span><span class="calibre4">and</span><span> your
        working memory. And as we know, we encounter myriad opportunities for those systems to fail, get
        captured by something salient, lose track of the goal, go blank, or become distracted by competing
        information.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>Problems Getting In: Failure to Encode</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>My mother-in-law called me recently, slightly
        panicked about her memory. As she has been getting older, lapses in her attention now upset her
        more—they could be indicators of a bigger problem, she believes, and that makes her nervous. I asked her
        to tell me exactly what happened.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>She recounted her shopping trip the day
        before. She was driving to the supermarket. Halfway there she realized she’d forgotten her list, so she
        started running over everything she was intending to buy in her mind. She parked at the supermarket, got
        out of the car, and made a mental note about where she parked. She went in, bought her groceries, and
        pushed the cart back to her car. But as she was loading the groceries into the trunk, she noticed a
        scrape on the paint. She felt a rush of irritation at herself. When on earth had she sideswiped
        something? She hadn’t even noticed!</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>She returned her cart, worrying about the
        scrape, and got in the driver’s seat—only to realize that this car had a manual transmission. Hers was
        an automatic.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span class="calibre4">She was in the wrong
        car.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>She located her own car—an identical model and
        color, without the scrape on the paint—just a couple of spots down in the same row, and sheepishly moved
        all her groceries. We both laughed together as she told me the story—to have gotten all the way into
        some stranger’s car! I explained to her that I didn’t think it was a problem with her memory—or, in
        fact, anything to do with the aging brain. Yes, our brains </span><span class="calibre4">do</span><span>
        age along with the rest of us. Parts of the brain get thinner and less dense, including the hippocampus
        and other medial-temporal lobe structures that we need to form explicit memories. And this can indeed
        cause memory issues. But in this episode, her whiteboard had simply been overloaded. As she was parking,
        she was rehearsing her forgotten list. She </span><span class="calibre4">thought</span><span> she was
        noting where she parked, but actually she was holding a ton of stuff on her whiteboard. She simply
        didn’t have room.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>A lot of the issues we see around memory and
        aging are actually misattributed. The problem is not “you’re losing your memory.” Rather, the problem is
        “you weren’t paying attention and failed to encode.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>A caveat to this story: where you parked your
        car isn’t something you’d ever really want to remember long-term. In fact, this is an example of one of
        those times when you want to be able to forget—imagine if you could remember every single place you ever
        parked and had to sift through all the locations every time you walked out the sliding doors of a
        grocery store. Like attention, memory </span><span class="calibre4">must</span><span> serve as a filter,
        selecting what’s relevant and what’s not, what should be highlighted, and what should be dumped. I use
        this story simply as an example of how holding a lot in your working memory can get in the way of
      </span><span class="calibre4">anything</span><span> making its way into long-term memory in any kind of
        effective way.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>And further: if your working memory is
        overloaded, knowledge from long-term memory can’t always get </span><span class="calibre4">out</span><span> when
        you need it. This was the cause of one of the deadliest “friendly
        fire” incidents in recent US history.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>Problems Getting Out: Failure to Retrieve</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>It was 2002, the height of the war in
        Afghanistan, and an American soldier was using a GPS system to guide a two-thousand-pound bomb to its
        intended target, an insurgent outpost. In this system, the soldier on the ground would input the
        coordinates for the airstrike into the handheld GPS device, and then the bomb would drop to hit that
        precise location. Before carrying out the strike, however, the soldier noticed that the batteries in the
        handheld GPS were low, so he switched them out for new ones. Then he sent the displayed coordinates to
        drop the bomb—which landed on his own battalion.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span class="calibre4">What happened?</span><span>
        In that GPS system, when the batteries are replaced, the rebooted system defaults to displaying the
        coordinates of its own location. The soldier operating the system </span><span
        class="calibre4">knew</span><span> this—he’d been trained extensively on the procedures. After you
        change out batteries, you have to re-input the drop coordinates. This knowledge was in his long-term
        memory; he’d rehearsed it many times. But for some reason, it didn’t “load” onto his whiteboard when he
        needed it. He looked at the faulty coordinates and sent them. A lot of people died that day. And it was
        because of a problem between one soldier’s long-term and working memory. I can only guess at the
        explanation, but it may be a tragically simple one: if working memory is overwhelmed by stress-induced
        mind-wandering, then knowledge may not surface when it’s most urgently needed.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>This is an extreme example, but any of us can
        experience breakdowns like these during processes of memory encoding and retrieval. Multiple steps are
        required in the process of encoding and retrieving memories, and all of them require your attention
      </span><span class="calibre4">and</span><span> your working memory.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>How to Make a Memory</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>To </span><span
        class="calibre4">remember</span><span>, you do three critical things. The first: </span><span
        class="calibre4">rehearsal.</span><span> You trace over information—the name you just heard as a new
        colleague introduced herself; the most important facts from the work training you’re in; the details of
        a good experience you just had. In school, when you studied with flashcards, that was rehearsal; when
        you go over the nuances of a joyful moment (your child’s wedding—the toasts, the taste of the cake),
        that too is rehearsal; when you find yourself reliving a painful or embarrassing moment, even that
        (unfortunately) also becomes rehearsal.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Then: </span><span
        class="calibre4">elaboration</span><span>. Similar to rehearsal, this involves relating new experiences
        or facts to knowledge or memories you already have. You can store a much stronger memory for things when
        you already have a base of knowledge. Example: picture an octopus. Now I tell you: </span><span
        class="calibre4">An octopus has three hearts.</span><span> If you didn’t already know that, you
        are—right now as you read this—</span><span class="calibre4">tethering</span><span> that new knowledge
        to that existing image you have of an octopus. The next time you see one in an aquarium or in a nature
        show on TV, you might suddenly remember, turn to your companion, and say, </span><span class="calibre4">Did you
        know that an octopus has three hearts?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>And finally: </span><span
        class="calibre4">consolidation.</span><span> This is what happens </span><span class="calibre4">as
        you’re performing</span><span> the above two functions, and it ultimately leads to the memory being
      </span><span class="calibre4">stored</span><span>. As the brain replays information, it’s laying down new
        neural pathways and then going over them, strengthening those new connections. This is, essentially, how
        information gets from working memory into long-term memory: the brain </span><span class="calibre4">structurally
        changes</span><span> to solidify a particular neural representation—and it
        needs time for unconstrained, spontaneous thought to do that. That’s why we think that mental downtime
        and sleep are both important: they’re opportunities for </span><span class="calibre4">memory
        consolidation</span><span>. It’s also part of the reason we experience mind-wandering—one thing that can
        fuel that mental roaming about is neural activity related to replaying experiences we’ve had. With more
        replays, all the noise fades away and the clear signal remains, which is what comprises the memory trace
        in the brain. If your attention is constantly engaged, with zero mental downtime for you to experience
        the emergence of conscious spontaneous thought, you may be degrading the link between working memory and
        long-term memory. You’re disabling vital consolidation processes.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The process of remembering—already subject to
        your framing, biases, experience, and previous knowledge—is fragile and easily disrupted. It gets
        derailed when your attention is hijacked away. When something other than what you want to remember takes
        over your working memory, the memory-making process is interrupted. And ironically, that “something” is
        often long-term memory itself.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>The “Raw Material” for Mind-Wandering</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Memory can fail if, during the process of
        encoding, attention does exactly what it often does: </span><span class="calibre4">wanders</span><span>.
        When it’s grabbed by some salient thing. When it strays back to the hot topics and preoccupations that
        have become </span><span class="calibre4">conflict states</span><span>. </span><a
        name="epubbookmark138"></a><span>Those attention-grabbing thoughts have as their raw materials long-term
        memory traces. These are concepts and experiences that can be reconfigured in new ways to create a new
        worry or they may comprise existing memories that are already fully formed. They become the content for
        mind-wandering.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>When I spoke earlier about </span><span
        class="calibre4">mental time travel</span><span>, what I meant was: you’ve been hijacked by content
        created by your own mind, using the raw materials from your long-term memory. This content can interfere
        with your ability to pay attention to what is taking place in the actual moment. And this makes it
        difficult for you to form new memories of your current experience.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Remember the </span><span class="calibre4">default
        mode network</span><span>—the brain network seen in study after study of
        mind-wandering? It turns out that this network is made up of smaller subnetworks. One of these
        subnetworks has nodes comprising the medial-temporal long-term memory system we’ve been talking about. I
        think of this subnetwork like a </span><span class="calibre4">thought pump</span><span>. </span><a
        name="epubbookmark139"></a><span>It pumps out content like memory traces and other mental chatter
        generated by raw memory input. It does this even without our conscious awareness.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>And sometimes, this pump spits out salient
        information that grabs our attentional flashlight. It’s no different than the pull on our flashlight
        when threatening, novel, shiny, or self-related stimuli happens in our external environment. In fact, a
        second subnetwork of the default mode network functions like a flashlight for the inner
        landscape—sometimes this is called the “core default mode network.” This term seems appropriate, given
        that self-relatedness is at the </span><span class="calibre4">core</span><span> of what grabs our

        “</span><span class="calibre4">Two years ago.</span><span>” And he replied, “Well, I guess the tape
        finally caught up.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We know by now that we need to </span><span
        class="calibre4">stay in play.</span><span> One of the reasons is that for the most part, you can only
        “record” in play-mode. The memory-making process begins in the present moment. Yes, there’s work that
        your brain does after that to make a memory a memory—but it starts with the raw input (from either the
        environment or your own mind) that you get from the </span><span class="calibre4">now</span><span>. You
        can’t do it later or put it off. </span><span class="calibre4">Now</span><span> is the only time you can
        record.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We have so much to think about: past events to
        process; future events to plan for and anticipate. Our time is so precious, so valuable, so often
        slipping through our fingers like sand. We can be in the middle of something that we need or want to
        remember, and we think, </span><span class="calibre4">I’ll come back to this later. I’ll think about it
        later. I’ll remember it later.</span><span class="calibre4">&#xa0;</span><span class="calibre4">.</span><span

        class="calibre4">.</span><span> But attention can’t be saved.
      </span><span class="calibre4">You have to use it now.</span><span> And when you realize that, it changes the
        way you orient to experiences—and the way you remember them.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>If you feel that you can’t participate in
        shared memories (like Richard from the Army Institute of Research did), or if you feel out of step with
        the events in your life (like Eric Schoomaker did, experiencing the “lag” in his tape), it may be an
      </span><span class="calibre4">embodied</span><span> attention problem. Our memories are strongly tied to our
        senses. So, one way to boost our chances of remembering the things we care about is to use mindfulness
        training to root ourselves </span><span class="calibre4">in the body.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>Remember Better</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Our memories for experiences, or episodic
        memory, involve vivid contextual details—sensory details like sounds and smells, how we felt, and what
        thoughts we had in the moment. Episodic memory has a highly specific state of consciousness associated
        with it, </span><a name="epubbookmark140"></a><span>called </span><span class="calibre4">autonoetic
        consciousness</span><span>. This term describes the embodied fullness—the richness, the detail, the
        three-dimensional depth—we have when we recall an episode from our lives with self-awareness. Try it out
        now: think of a specific favorite childhood memory. Maybe it’s a memory of getting ice cream with your
        grandmother on a hot summer day, or washing your family car with your siblings. Autonoetic consciousness
        is that feeling of having experienced the event from the inside. You might remember the tastes, sounds,
        smells, expressions on others’ faces. You might remember feeling joy or happiness. And recalling it may
        actually produce a small jolt of joy right now.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>How we remember episodic memory also gives us
        a clue as to </span><span class="calibre4">how to encode</span><span> episodic memory. For more detail
        and richness, we fill up our whiteboards with all those granular elements</span><span class="calibre4">.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Your working memory is a great tool for
        memory, and also a major point of vulnerability—if it’s occupied with other content besides the
        experience you want to encode or the information you’re trying to learn, there won’t be effective
        memory-making. Simply being physically present for something doesn’t mean you’ll absorb it. You need to
        intentionally place your focus (flashlight) on what you want to encode. And further: you need to make
        sure both your mind </span><span class="calibre4">and body</span><span> show up for the stuff you want
        to remember.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>In our next core practice, you’ll anchor
        yourself in your physical sensations. You may begin to notice discomfort, or even pain. It might be a
        breeze on your skin or an itch on your forehead. It might be hunger. It might even be the complete
      </span><span class="calibre4">absence</span><span> of sensation. Regardless of what’s there, you place your
        flashlight on it. Use your flashlight like a searchlight and move it slowly through the body—in doing
        so, you practice </span><span class="calibre4">being in the body</span><span> in the present moment. You

          attention to your breath sensations.</span></li>
      <li class="num1bx" style="margin-right:17pt; margin-left:53pt"><span>But now, we’re not going to keep it
          there, on the breath. We’re going to move it through the body. We’re going to keep that focus—that

          through the body.</span></li>
      <li class="num1bx" style="margin-right:17pt; margin-left:53pt"><span>Start by directing your attention to
          one of your toes. Take note of whatever sensations you notice there. Cold? Warm? Tingling? Tightness

      <li class="num1bx" style="margin-right:17pt; margin-left:53pt"><span>Go slowly! If you’re trying this for
          three minutes, as with the last exercise, think of your body in thirds and take about a minute with
          each section. Gradually move your attention up from your lower body—your lower legs and then your
          upper legs—to your core: the pelvic area, lower torso, upper torso; to your upper body: your
          shoulders, upper arms, lower arms, and hands. Then finally move attention up to your neck, your
          face, the back of your head, and finally the top of your head.</span></li>
      <li class="num1bx" style="margin-right:17pt; margin-left:53pt"><span>Pay attention to each sensation—or lack

        start to see how stress, worries, and emotions are showing up in the body. You can start to observe your

    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>My daughter is a dancer. I was annoyed the
        first time I went to one of her recitals and discovered their hard and fast rule: </span><span
        class="calibre4">no video or photography.</span><span> I put my phone back in my purse, a little upset
        that I wouldn’t be able to record Sophie’s performance for posterity. Then, as I sat there watching her
        on stage, illuminated in the spotlight, I felt my attention begin to focus and intensify. I mentally
        zoomed in on her. I remember trying my best to </span><span class="calibre4">feel</span><span> her
        dance. To notice the way she moved, the soft thumping sounds of her feet on the stage coming through
        under the music, the tight look on her face when she began and the satisfied look when she finished,
        knowing she’d done well. The fullness of the experience felt really good to me. In that instance, I
        simply had no choice but to fully pay attention. And my memory of that recital is still vivid.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>At the beginning of this chapter, we looked at
        how using devices like phones and laptops to preserve stuff we want to remember can massively backfire,
        making it </span><span class="calibre4">less</span><span> likely that we’ll remember what we most want
        to. So, do you need to put down the phone?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Not necessarily. </span><a
        name="epubbookmark141"></a><span>Another study involving participants taking photographs of artwork in a
        museum initially found the same as the one we discussed earlier: photographing the artwork left people
        remembering less. As before, when they “offloaded” into the camera, they also forgot the content. But
        here there was a twist. They were then asked to use the camera’s ability to zoom in on a particular
        segment of a painting as they photographed it. In that instance, their ability to recall details of the
        experience rocketed back up. The simple act of zooming in—deciding what to focus on and then doing
        it—allowed people to remember more depth and detail of the experience.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I’m not saying that you shouldn’t photograph
        things that are important to you. But the next time you do take out your phone to capture something you
        want to remember, take a minute. Take in the scene outside the rectangle of the phone. Hold in your mind
        what you really want to remember. Notice the details, the sights and smells and colors; notice your own
        emotions. What you’re doing is maximizing and integrating the elements of the experience in your working
        memory in order to encode the fullness of the experience. Imagine viewing a scene in color instead of in
        black and white, or in 3D instead of 2D. Mindfulness exercises help train your attention to be more
        fully in the moment as it’s happening—which can add that fullness to your episodic memories.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>You don’t need to make every photograph you
        take a huge exercise in mindfulness—sometimes a photo can just be a photo! But it’s very easy to live
        our lives behind these devices and to create a stream of digital memories without making </span><span
        class="calibre4">actual</span><span> memories. And combating this need not be a time-intensive process.
        Simply taking a moment to mindfully notice and to fully experience events or surroundings could make a
        big difference in our ability to remember them. When there’s something you really want to remember,
      </span><span class="calibre4">zoom in.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>And finally: if you want to remember the
        things you experience and the things you learn, you need to allow for the free flow of spontaneous
        thought. If your days are all engagement, all the time, you’re skipping a critical step we discussed
        earlier: opportunities for </span><span class="calibre4">consolidation.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>At the grocery store, you fill your cart and
        head to the checkout. Bummer—there’s a long line at every station. You get in the shortest line and pull
        out your phone. There’s a work email and a personal one—you read both, then start drafting a response to
        the work one with your thumb. A notification pings and you click it; the email draft autosaves and you
        swipe over to Twitter, where someone in your field has replied to something you posted earlier. You want
        to be supportive, so you click the heart and retweet, then scroll—a news article about climate change
        catches your eye and you tap it. You’re halfway through skimming the article when the checker announces
        your total, loading plastic bags into your cart—the eco-friendly canvas bags you brought are still
        tucked under your arm.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Sound familiar? I know it does to me. We live
        busy lives. The urge to pack as much as possible into every pocket of time is intense. If I didn’t draft

        doing</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.
        something else.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>It often seems necessary to use our time in
        this way—we think of time as a commodity; it has a price, and it’s generally quite valuable. We don’t
        want to waste it. And we don’t see mental downtime, when we purposefully disengage from finding,
        gripping, and tightly pointing our attentional flashlight to some urgent and occupying task, as a
        valuable thing to do. But that’s only because most of us don’t realize how critically necessary it is.
        Ever had a great idea in the shower? It’s not because the scent of your shampoo is oh, so inspiring—the
        shower is forced mental downtime. You can’t take your phone in there, or your laptop, or a book. You’re
        trapped in a small, wet box with nothing in particular demanding your attention. It can become a
        creative, generative time where you make connections, or have ideas, or maybe sink into daydreams that
        actually have the vital function of assisting in memory formation and solidifying learning.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We need white space in order to reflect on
        what we hear and experience. For those in leadership roles, this can feel like a challenge, but also a
        chance to do something innovative. Memory-making and learning are benefits of mindfulness training, yes,
        but you need both: </span><a name="epubbookmark142"></a><span>to be </span><span class="calibre4">mentally
        present in the moment</span><span>, and then to have </span><span class="calibre4">space to let the mind roam

        day. Try this: Leave your phone in your pocket or purse. If you are up for it, leave it hidden in the
        car. At work, walking from one meeting to the next, feel your feet walking and let whatever comes to
        mind come and go. Remind yourself that these unconstrained mind moments are valuable—more valuable than

        highly “sticky” content is circulating in working memory, and to intervene by coming back to the present

        memories can feel indelibly written, as if etched into metal. Are they unique? Like many important
        topics, this one is under active debate. What we do know is that trauma leads to: reexperiencing the
        stressful event, avoiding reminders of the trauma, and over-activating the alerting system. These
        symptoms lessen and resolve over time. But when they don’t and people continue to suffer, it becomes a

        pretty hard to go through life without accumulating some of those. And we all need tools to deal with
        that. A big part of that is knowing when, and </span><span class="calibre4">how,</span><span> to address
        the stuff that’s coming up repeatedly on your whiteboard. We’ve practiced noticing the </span><span

    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Certain things may become “sticky” on our

        ourselves (“I will never amount to anything”). An incident where you made a mistake becomes “I always
        get this stuff wrong—I’m such an idiot!” It’s not the incident itself that takes center stage on your
        whiteboard: it’s the generalization you derived from it. The oversimplified packaging allows it to
        remain in working memory with minimal effort: it’s short, it’s clear, and it probably isn’t
        accurate.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The generalizations we come up with can be
        helpful because they efficiently condense information we need to remember. Yet generalizations can be

        top levels that this was </span><span class="calibre4">it.</span><span> All he had to do was give the
        okay, and the camp would be obliterated.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Piatt and his soldiers, though, were already
        on the mountain. They were close enough to be able to hike up. It would be a tough climb—the camp was at
        eleven thousand feet, and it was starting to snow. But Piatt felt strongly that someone in the vicinity
        should get a good physical look at the camp. So on that cold morning, with whipping snow filling the
        air, a team of scouts headed further up, looking for final confirmation that this indeed was the Taliban
        cell.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>As the team of scouts ascended, Piatt was
        getting messages from his leadership reminding him over and over that he had authority to engage—that
        the scouts weren’t necessary. But he waited. Finally, the radio clicked on and the lead scout called in
        to report. His team was close enough to see for themselves that everything checked out: encampment,
        tents, a young bearded man circling the camp, obviously standing guard. Then another guy, walking along
        with him: a pair of patrols.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“So that was it—game on,” Piatt recalls. “We
        had a camp, a couple of guards—it all confirmed what we already knew.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Piatt was about to launch the ground assault
        when the scout’s voice came over the radio again.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“Wait a minute, wait a minute,” he said. “I
        don’t see a weapon on this guy. Repeat. </span><span class="calibre4">No weapons!</span><span>”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>There was a moment of frozen silence.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“We’re so close,” the soldier said. “We can
        just tackle them!”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The soldiers rushed out of the snowy fog and
        took the guys to the ground. The rest of the patrol came in behind them with their weapons drawn, ready
        for a deluge of Taliban fighters to come swarming out of the tents. Instead: a very aggravated, tall,
        and imposing woman burst out of one of the tents, shouting. They couldn’t understand her, but the gist
        was: </span><span class="calibre4">Let go of my men!</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The intel had been wrong. The “insurgent
        encampment” was in fact the winter camp of a Bedouin tribe. The tents were filled with families. They
        had been making their way to this land for centuries, to let their animals graze. They had absolutely no
        affiliation with the Taliban.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>In this situation, what we call “confirmation
        bias” could have killed a whole tribe of people. </span><a name="epubbookmark146"></a><span>Confirmation
        bias is common—it happens when people essentially “see what they expect to see,” discounting any
        information that doesn’t line up with their expectation. The team of soldiers sent up the mountain
        expected to see a Taliban camp, so at first, that’s what they “saw.” It took only one person who was
        able to see things clearly to avert disaster.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Walt Piatt thought about that day on the
        mountain for years after it happened. He reflected on what a valuable skill it was to be able to quickly
        and flexibly drop expectations, and instead to see what was </span><span class="calibre4">really
        happening</span><span> right in front of you. It wasn’t something that typical military training
        covered—and that struck him as a big problem. He wondered: What gave </span><span
        class="calibre4">that</span><span> soldier the ability to see the scene so accurately, when everyone
        around him was viewing it through a biased lens? And was there any way to train other service members to
        acquire that ability?</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>The Power of a Story</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>One of the motivating reasons I wanted to work
        with military service members was exactly that: I wanted to know if we could help them not only to
      </span><span class="calibre4">pay attention</span><span> better, but also to be more discerning and
      </span><span class="calibre4">situationally aware.</span><span> Situational awareness—the mental state of
        constantly knowing what’s going on around you—is critical for people in a variety of professions,
        including police and first responders. Could mindfulness training, I wondered, help soldiers (or anyone)
        come into situations less susceptible to biased thinking so they could see more clearly, be less
        reactive, and respond appropriately and proportionately?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Our prediction was </span><span
        class="calibre4">yes</span><span>, because of how mindfulness practice guides you to use your attention:
        in the present moment, without judgment, elaboration, or reactivity. In other words: </span><span
        class="calibre4">without making up a story about what you’re experiencing</span><span>.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Sometimes a story is given to us and we
        quickly accept it—like the soldiers and the expected insurgent camp. Other times we arrive at the story
        ourselves, through our own mental simulation. </span><a name="epubbookmark147"></a><span>We are
        incessantly concocting narratives about what might happen in an hour, or tomorrow, or about what others
        are thinking or feeling, or about their motivations. We visualize options and courses of action. We
        imagine how events might play out so that we can be more prepared; we troubleshoot various
        possibilities: </span><span class="calibre4">If she says x, should I reply y or z? If that road is
        closed, what detour will I take? If the schools reopen while COVID cases are still high and new variants
        are emerging, will we send our kids?</span><span> To visualize the possible answers to such questions,
        you create a whole world in your mind, with sensory details, characters, plot lines, and sometimes even
        dialogue. You experience emotions in response to this world you’ve created—it makes you feel sad, or
        anxious, or satisfied—and those feelings help you make decisions about what you may choose to do
        next</span><span class="calibre4">.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We use simulations to arrive at </span><a
        name="epubbookmark148"></a><span class="calibre4">mental models</span><span> that guide our thinking,
        decision making, and actions. This is really what I mean when I say “story.” You come up with these
        mental models, or “stories,” rapidly and constantly—you simulate, arrive at one, then use it and move
        on; or you receive new information that causes you to update or dump that story and simulate a different
        one. The key ingredients for your simulations? Memories of episodes you have experienced in your life,
        fragments of these memories, plus everything else you have learned and remember. Add to the mix your
        capacity to think, reason, and forecast, and voilà—a freshly simulated new story!</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The simulation process is vivid, detail-rich,
        and captivating, and the mental model requires our attention and working memory to come alive. But it
        also puts heavy demands on these limited capacity systems. That’s part of the reason stories are so
        powerful: they can become a kind of “shorthand” for efficiently framing and maintaining a situation,
        problem, or plan in mind—and this efficiency helps free up cognitive resources to do other things. But
        (there’s always a </span><span class="calibre4">but</span><span>) stories also constrain information
        processing. They </span><span class="calibre4">capture and keep</span><span> our attention locked onto a
        subset of data. Now our perceptions, our thinking, even our decisions are constrained. So when the story
        you come up with is </span><span class="calibre4">wrong,</span><span> then your actions and decisions
        after that can skew wrong, too—</span><span class="calibre4">because of the way the story interacts with
        attention.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Remember that famous experiment with the
        dancing gorilla that I described to you earlier in this book? To refresh your memory: There are two
        teams on a basketball court, one dressed in black T-shirts and the other in white, and study
        participants are asked to count the number of passes that occur between players on the white-shirted
        team. In the middle of the “game,” a guy dressed as a gorilla walks through the scene, does a little
        dance, and then strolls off. And the people counting passes </span><span class="calibre4">completely
        miss it.</span><span> Why? Because they were asked to watch the white-shirted players, they (very
        appropriately and skillfully!) screened out everything dark—including that gorilla.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I presented that study to you to highlight the
        incredible </span><span class="calibre4">power</span><span> of attention, and it certainly does. But it
        also highlights a potentially catastrophic weak spot. The people in the study had a clear-cut, simple
        mission: </span><span class="calibre4">filter out the color black, focus on the color
        white.</span><span> Yet in a real-life situation, we usually don’t know ahead of time what we should
        focus on and what we should filter out. And in a real-life situation, the stakes for “missing the
        gorilla” can be a lot higher.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>Why It’s So Hard to Drop the Story</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The mind’s job when it’s in “simulation mode”
        is to </span><span class="calibre4">transport you.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Think of things that transport you so that
        you’re completely absorbed in another world and lose track of time: movies, books, video games. What are
        the qualities of these media? They draw you in because of their compelling narrative, their vivid
        detail, their rich emotional meaning. The end result of all this is that your attention is transfixed
        and doesn’t waver—that’s what a good story does. It’s all-consuming. And so is a simulation that you
        generate in your own mind. Your mind is a </span><span class="calibre4">great</span><span> simulator.
        It’s capable of that exact type of intensive, immersive, </span><span
        class="calibre4">all-consuming</span><span> story creation.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Our own minds are wildly versatile simulation
        generators: we can create “movies” on the screen of our whiteboards, reliving past experiences,
        predicting future ones, and more. Our simulations give us the capacity to </span><span
        class="calibre4">relive</span><span> and </span><span class="calibre4">pre-live.</span><span> We believe
        this is a unique capacity of the human mind—this ability to “try out” multiple different possibilities
        and time lines, to imagine scenarios before we enter into them. You don’t have to drive five different
        routes to figure out which is the best one: you simulate them mentally and then choose one and drive it,
        based on expected traffic congestion and maybe even the scenery. The ability to produce—in vivid
        detail—an imagined future based on our past experiences and knowledge is incredibly useful and powerful.
        This is a desirable </span><span class="calibre4">feature</span><span> of the brain—not a flaw. You
        would not ever want to be without it.</span></p>

    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Let’s look at that last one. Over the past
        week, how many times have you imagined a potential outcome, just to see how you might feel about it? An
        outdated (yet still common) view is that feelings are a nuisance—a distraction that gets in the way of
        logical and efficient decision making. In fact, having an emotional reaction </span><span
        class="calibre4">during</span><span> the decision-making process is indispensable. Without emotion, we’d
        be left floundering. </span><a name="epubbookmark149"></a><span>Emotion is how the brain determines the
        value of something (say, an event or a choice). If you choose A over B, do you feel: angry, happy,
        disgusted, sad, fearful? Your simulation—and the feelings that arise—allows you to come to a
        decision.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>In the lead-up to the 2020 US presidential
        election, voters across the entire country were likely simulating what it would feel like to have a
        particular candidate win. And our simulations continued as the votes slowly came in, as projections
        shifted, as social media opined, and as lawsuits were filed. Simulations can be powerful not only in
        guiding decision making, but also in helping us emotionally prepare to accept particular
        outcomes.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Your brain is quite possibly the best, most
        robust “virtual-reality” machine there is. We can create entire worlds. We can project ourselves through
        time and geography and into the minds of others. We need this capacity for everything we are able to
        successfully do as humans: for imagining, for strategizing and planning, for decision making and problem
        solving, for innovating and creating, for connecting, and much more.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The problem? Our virtual-reality capabilities
        are a double-edged sword: our simulations can be </span><span class="calibre4">too good.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>To have your simulation inform your eventual
        decisions, plans, and actions, you need to feel as if you are there—to really see, hear, and feel it. To
        this end, the brain mobilizes its powers of perception, conceptualization, elaboration, and narration to
        create the most vivid, detailed, and realistic world that it can. And “vivid” in the internal landscape
        of your mind is the same as “salient” in the external landscape: think of it as </span><span
        class="calibre4">very loud.</span><span> It grabs your attention and holds it. Your flashlight snaps to
        it without any effort at all.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Remember </span><span class="calibre4">perceptual
        decoupling</span><span>? We talked about this earlier in the book when I
        introduced mind-wandering. When you’re mind-wandering, you sort of “unhook” from your actual immediate
        environment. Well, that’s exactly what happens when you have a simulation running. The simulation is
        salient and loud; everything else gets dimmed down. Sensory input becomes degraded and inconsistent;
        this effect gets even worse when we’re dealing with stress, threat, poor mood, or fatigue. When you’re
        deep in a simulation (aka “deep in thought”), someone could be calling your name and you would not hear
        them. Even </span><span class="calibre4">touch</span><span> may become dulled.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Our simulations are so effective that we get
        immersed and </span><span class="calibre4">fused with them</span><span>, and </span><span
        class="calibre4">persuaded by them.</span><span> </span><a name="epubbookmark150"></a><span>Studies on
        the impact of advertising have shown that </span><span class="calibre4">vividness</span><span> is what
        grabs people’s attention and convinces them to buy. With simulations, we create our own persuasive
        content. So persuasive, in fact, that our bodies physically respond: When presented with an image of a
        slice of cake, people’s mouths will water; show a smoker a picture of a cigarette and they will
        experience intense craving. With a stressful memory or a stressful simulation, we’ll experience the
        release of stress hormones. Our minds and bodies begin to believe we are really experiencing the
        simulated event.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>And finally: </span><span class="calibre4">we
        are simulating all the time.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>A Simulation Is Always Running</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>So far, I’ve been talking about simulating as
        something we do on purpose, for active decision making and planning. In fact, you are simulating all the
        time.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Remember that 50 percent of the time when
        you’re mind-wandering? As we discussed, when your mind wanders, your </span><span class="calibre4">default mode
        network</span><span> is activated. The default mode is massively involved
        in simulation: your attention and working memory are mobilized inward and you begin simulating versions
        of reality, projecting yourself into the past or future, or even into other people’s minds and lives.
        Much of the time that you’re mind-wandering</span><span class="calibre4">, you’re simulating.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I was struck by a recent quote I read by the
        actor Jim Carrey: </span><a name="epubbookmark151"></a><span>“Our eyes are not only viewers, but
        projectors that are running a second story over the picture we see in front of us all the time.”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I don’t know if Carrey has ever taken a basic
        neuroscience class, but I’ll say this: he’s spot on. And therein lies the problem. Our simulations
        happen even when we don’t actively choose to engage in them. They can constrain our information
        processing in confounding and unhelpful ways, affect our well-being, impair our judgment, and hinder our
        decision making.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>This incessant simulating we do (largely by

    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>My family and I recently traveled to my mom’s
        house to celebrate a milestone birthday with her. On the day of her big birthday party, the house was
        crowded with longtime family friends, most of them Indian men and women in their sixties and seventies.
        As the party wore on, my sister and I rushed to replace platters of food and serve drinks. When the time
        came to serve the cake, I was at a loss—my daughter was nowhere to be found, and my sister was busy
        cutting and plating the cake while I ran frantically back and forth with two plates, trying to get to
        all the guests. Finally, I felt a hand on my arm. My husband, Michael, was standing there with our son
        and my nephew.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“Can we help you?” he asked, looking a little
        baffled that I hadn’t asked already.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I was startled and immediately felt silly:
      </span><span class="calibre4">of course</span><span> they could help! They’d been sitting right there, in
        front of me the entire time. I asked them each to grab some plates and, within minutes, everyone in the
        room had cake in hand.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Why didn’t I think to ask them? I reflected on
        it later, bothered by my inability in the moment to see the males in the room as helpers. Why had I only
        thought of my daughter and sister as “servers”?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span class="calibre4">Because men don’t serve food

    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I was shocked at the sexism in my own mental
        model. Yet I could not deny that my attention was biased, entirely on the basis of sex. My flashlight
        was only scanning for females who could help me. It was as if the males were blanked out of my field of
        view. My actions were then biased, too—with no females in sight, I felt compelled to serve the cake on
        my own. It took Michael’s gentle question for me to snap out of my own story. With the blinders suddenly
        off, my attention broadened to more easily see additional options on how to maneuver through the
        situation.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>As a woman in the sciences, I’m acutely aware
        of the casual and constant ways that unnoticed biases can manifest, every day. It’s not uncommon for me
        to receive an email addressed “Sir,” or to answer my office phone and be asked “Is Dr. Jha available?
        When will he be in?” I still hear older relatives refer to seeing a “lady doctor” during a medical
        appointment.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>As I reflect on my own biases, I want to
        shout, </span><span class="calibre4">“But I’m not sexist!”</span><span> Yet here’s the reality: our
        mental models rely on our memories and knowledge for their inputs. So if sexism exists in the world, it
        exists in my lived experience of the world. And this means that it also exists in the memory traces of
        this lived experience in my brain. Accepting this frees me up in a useful way. I can be on the lookout
        for sexist influences in my own mental models. And when I see them, knowing that they will bias my
        attention </span><span class="calibre4">and</span><span> my behavior, I can intervene. I can build a
        new, better-informed model.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>However, when we’re </span><span
        class="calibre4">unaware</span><span> of the mental models that are guiding us, we may not be able to
        pivot away from them. The decisions and actions we make, while perhaps sensible under our model, may be
        inappropriate in reality and can have consequences for ourselves—as well as for others. The science of
        bias and attention has clear implications for the training of police and first responders, for
        physicians, for teachers, for lawyers and
        judges</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.
        well, for all of us. We all have a sphere of influence in the world. And we all have deeply seated
        biases that can show up in mental models, which means we have a responsibility to become more aware of
        the mental models we each hold.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>A flawed mental model can affect us in all
        kinds of ways—</span><span class="calibre4">bias</span><span> is a big one, but any time we simulate a
        certain outcome and can’t drop it, we can suffer because of it. If you go into a conversation with
        someone expecting it to be contentious, that mental model can ensure that you selectively focus on the
        aspects of the interaction that reinforce that story, and dim down competing information that might have
        offered a better way forward.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Because mental models are made from fragments
        of our own knowledge and experience, along with our observations in the moment, they can be </span><span

        Making predictions based on what has happened in your past experience can allow you to plan and prepare.
        Yet things don’t always unfold the way they have in the past or even the way you think they will based
        on information you’ve been given—like those soldiers going up the mountain in Afghanistan who’d received
        flawed intel. That day, after the dust settled (literally and metaphorically), Walt Piatt was invited
        into the tribe leaders’ tent to sit with the elders and share some of the hot chai they were pouring.
        The Army’s interpreter didn’t speak the tribe’s dialect, but they were able to communicate in some basic
        ways. As he sipped the hot liquid, Piatt looked around the dim room at all the people who would have
        lost their lives had someone on his team not been able to “drop the story” and allow in the
        contradictory information: </span><span class="calibre4">the man was not carrying a weapon.</span><span>
        Had they mistakenly obliterated the camp, they might never have come to realize their error. They might
        have carried on, believing the story that they’d successfully bombed a Taliban camp and achieved their
        mission.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Nuanced, flawed, and incomplete content is
        often the raw material feeding our simulations, from both long-term memory and the world around us, and

        conscious awareness of it. This is the content that scaffolds what we simulate in the stories we
        generate. So, what can we do about it? How do we use our incredible virtual-reality powers to imagine,
        plan, and strategize, without being limited and constrained?</span></p>

      </span><span class="calibre4">situational awareness</span><span>: your ability to observe and see clearly
        what’s happening in any given situation you find yourself in. You’re not elaborating on what you see or
        think or feel. You’re not analyzing or extrapolating from thoughts or feelings. You’re not taking what’s
        happening in one moment and spooling it out into the future, imagining what might happen next, or
        connecting back to similar situations you’ve encountered in the past, expecting them to be the same. In
        this mindful mode, you </span><span class="calibre4">don’t</span><span> try to predict or strategize or

    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>You’re not simulating.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>You may have noticed that there are many
        books, apps, and entire programs and workshops out in the world dealing with mindfulness. They describe
        a “mindful mode” as having specific qualities, many of which begin with “non”—as in non-elaborative,
        nonjudgmental, non-narrative. For many years, I wondered how these qualities hang together. But when we
        look at what it takes to have vivid, rich simulations, we see how they do. Simulation mode requires
        default mode activity. Meanwhile, mindfulness reduces default mode activity.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>In short: mindfulness becomes an “antidote” to
        relentless simulation.</span></p>

    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>My answer to that: It’s not that you want to
        live an entire life where you’re always in the “perpetual now”—that’s not what I’m advocating. But
        training the mind to be able to shift into a mindful mode vs. the highly prevalent simulation mode is a

    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Without intervention, we live our lives almost
        entirely in simulation mode. We default to it automatically—we do it constantly, effortlessly, and often
        unwittingly. It’s very difficult for us to not simulate, not elaborate, not generate, which is exactly
        why we need to train for this capacity. We need to be able to shift out of a simulation mode into a
        mindful one so that we can open our eyes and see what is actually around us vs. the virtual reality of
        our making. This capacity is becoming more and more essential as our world becomes more unpredictable.
        In recent years, we’ve faced unprecedented challenges, from pandemics to politics and many more, and the
        future holds more uncertainty. We cannot live in simulation mode through this. To be resilient and
        capable, to preserve our attentional and cognitive powers, we have to be able to access the mindful
        mode.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Both of the columns in the table will lead you
        to a mental model, and both have their utility. The difference is, the mental model you arrive at by
        using the mindful mode, instead of the simulation mode, has a much better chance of being
        unbiased.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Ultimately, though, the goal is not to rely
        solely on a single mode all the time. Both modes are valuable. We can gather critical information from
        both. The goal is to have the capacity to shift into a mindful mode when you need it. We need to be able
        to toggle—to drop the story, for a few minutes at least, in order to create mental models that are the
        most accurate depictions of the situation we are in. If we can train ourselves to more quickly and
        effectively move into a mindful mode, that short break from the simulation mode will then allow us to
        reenter it with a better idea of which of the many possibilities we can choose from is the best one. So

          agile you’ll be when it’s time to drop a story and pivot. Just because you’ve been in a past

          prediction, or other simulation you have is only one of many possibilities—not an immutable fact.

        mindfulness training to older adults—a particularly at-risk population during the pandemic—specifically
        to help them manage fear, stress, and loneliness. Going into the study, we wanted to know if people were
        finding their own thoughts and worries about the pandemic to be disruptive, and if so, at what
        level.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>To answer this, we used a “COVID Intrusion

        often they found themselves thinking about COVID, and when they did, how distressing those thoughts
        were. Did their thoughts come out of the blue? Were they unwanted? We also asked questions about their
        mood, their stress level, and their </span><span class="calibre4">capacity to decenter</span><span>, by
        which I mean that we probed their ability to </span><span class="calibre4">see thoughts and feelings as

    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We found that those with </span><span

        the intensity of their negative mood on a scale of 1 (not at all) to 5 (very negative). Unsurprisingly,

    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The study showed that decentering </span><span

        is on our mood. The interpretation of the brain imaging findings was that people had the least amount of

    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>Weakening the “Pull” of Simulations</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I’ve been asked why I don’t emphasize “stress
        reduction” when I discuss the topic of mindfulness. My answer to that? I study attention, and
        mindfulness training entered my laboratory’s research in our search to find effective cognitive training
        tools to improve attention. Most of the groups we approach are not primarily interested in reducing
        stress—that is not their goal. Rather, their goal, like ours, is to strengthen attention and optimize
        attention-related performance. The great thing, though, is that mindfulness training does both: it
        reduces stress </span><span class="calibre4">and</span><span> improves attention. And being able to
        weaken the pull of simulations by </span><span class="calibre4">decentering</span><span> is key to
        achieving both of these benefits.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Some mindfulness exercises emphasize
      </span><span class="calibre4">voluntarily paying attention, noticing mind-wandering,</span><span> and
      </span><span class="calibre4">redirecting it as needed</span><span> (like the </span><span class="calibre4">Find
        Your Flashlight</span><span> practice), while other exercises target the
      </span><span class="calibre4">capacity to decenter</span><span> (you’ll learn such a practice up ahead).
        With greater control over the flashlight and awareness of where it is directed, we can catch our
        mind-wandering more often to get attention back on track. And with greater decentering, we can dial down
        the strong hold that our mind-wandering episodes have on us, especially for those that are filled with
        powerful, emotionally charged negative and worry-filled simulations. These are the ones that not only
        grab us but </span><span class="calibre4">hook</span><span> us. They capture our attention and keep it
        there to loop on, as in rumination.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Decentering is a powerful technique because it
        weakens the hold that mind-wandering episodes can have on our attention. You’re able to “drop the story”
        when it isn’t serving you or when it’s causing you distress. By unhooking attention in this way,
      </span><a name="epubbookmark158"></a><span>decentering leads to reduced stress and even reduced symptoms of

    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I prepared meticulously, working on my slides
        in advance. I made sure I had our most recent science incorporated and fine-tuned the flow from slide to
        slide. I was ready. I packed up my laptop with the presentation loaded and prepared—backups for
        everything, just in case—and flew to DC the night before my talk. I arrived, had a nice dinner, and was
        preparing to turn in for the night so I would be fresh and ready. But when I popped open my laptop to
        quickly peek at my email and make sure there wasn’t anything urgent from the lab, a message grabbed my
        attention. It was from a colleague, an Army colonel and a professor at the Army War College. I’d sent
        him my PowerPoint slides the day before, asking if he had any thoughts or advice on how to optimize it
        for an audience of strategic military leaders. I imagined that if he had the time to take a look at all
        (given his busy teaching schedule), he might offer a few minor tweaks. But when I opened the email, my
        stomach sank—he’d run the presentation past a focus group of his students, and there were extensive
        notes on nearly every slide.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The suggestions were sweeping: </span><span

        mind scrambled around, trying to work out how I could possibly make all these changes so last-minute. I
        was grateful for the time and thoughtfulness of his feedback, but with so little time, I also felt
        overwhelmed and worried. I could feel the swell of unhelpful and very negative thoughts fill up my mind.
      </span><span class="calibre4">I’m never going to be able to get this done. I’m going to fail!</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I closed the laptop and decided to take five
        minutes to do a mini-practice. I knew that what I needed to do was zoom out and get a bird’s-eye view of

    </ol>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>It was only five minutes. But what that
        mini-practice allowed me to do was </span><span class="calibre4">decouple from</span><span> the story
        that I had started narrating, one filled with worry and doubt. I was watching what was on my whiteboard,
        at a distance. I noticed thoughts, feelings, and bodily sensations arising and passing away without
        being overtaken by them. I quickly dropped the story and stopped drafting up worst-case scenarios. And
        seeing myself “in the third person” made me want to encourage Amishi instead of tear her down. I wanted
        to be supportive of myself, as I would be for a good friend. By the end of the mini-practice, I felt
        clearer and less reactive. Decentering in this way, for only a few minutes, allowed me to reconnect with
        my intention: to give my audience a successful learning experience.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>And to do so, I needed to reach them, which
        was exactly what my colleague’s feedback would help me do. I returned to the presentation, curious about

      </span><span class="calibre4">In this file, there is useful guidance to help me educate and inform my

    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The day after my presentation, I got a text

    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>A lot of people whom I work with have an
        initial resistance to the idea of “dropping the story.” They exist in worlds where planning,

        presented at the Pentagon, during which I discussed </span><a name="epubbookmark159"></a><span>my team’s
        research findings on offering a program called Mindfulness-Based Attention Training (MBAT) to
        conventional and special operations forces within the US Army, there was a short Q and A session with
        the audience. When it began, retired Lieutenant General Eric Schoomaker, the 42nd Surgeon General of the
        Army, raised his hand first.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“Why are you telling us not to engage in
        narrative?” he asked. “We need to build stories in order to be prepared for the future.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“Absolutely,” I replied. “And there is nothing
        within mindfulness practice that instructs you not to build stories. It’s simply that you should be
        aware, in all circumstances, </span><span class="calibre4">that</span><span> you are building a story.
        And you should be aware that any story you have, at any point in time, is just one of many possible
        outcomes or interpretations. It’s not the only one, and it may not be correct.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I conveyed to him what I convey to many who

        is: </span><span class="calibre4">Maybe.</span><span> Research is unfolding about whether or not
        mindfulness practice can help reduce implicit biases—this could have huge implications for all of us and
        for our institutions, for example our justice system. It’s promising, but we just don’t have the data
        yet. What we have looked at is the intersection of mindfulness and discriminatory behavior</span><span
        class="calibre4">.</span><span> </span><a name="epubbookmark160"></a><span>Studies are finding that
        mindfulness training can indeed help people </span><span class="calibre4">act</span><span> in
        less-biased ways, perhaps because they are more aware of the mental models they hold and more able to
        drop the story.</span></p>

    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>A group of psychologists came to the lab to
        discuss incorporating mindfulness practice into their own training. They weren’t ordinary
        psychologists—they were operational psychologists with the US military, which means that they provide
        mission support to deployed units and are, on occasion, embedded in those units. One of their
        responsibilities is supporting service members who regularly spend long, twelve-hour shifts watching
        drone footage. The psychologists wanted to know what they could do to support the service members in
        that role.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>To best answer that question, I needed an
        answer to one of my own first: When these service members are watching drone footage for a dozen hours
        straight, what is the purpose of their watching? Why are they doing it?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The reply: “They are a key part of the ‘kill
        chain.’”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>It was a startling statement. I realized
        immediately what he meant: that they were in charge of spotting targets and relaying that information up
        the chain of command. Even with all the work I’ve done with the military, this made me pause. It’s easy
        to assume that it’s the people in charge who wield most of the power and carry most of the weight for
        the decisions that are made, and for the actions taken by our military. But every single person in our
        military carries the weight of every decision they make. It reminds me of why I do this work—to help
        them make the right ones. And in a situation like this one, it’s absolutely crucial for these people to
        be aware of what kind of biases they are bringing to the job. This is the place where the story you have
        is going to influence what you’re seeing—if you think someone’s a terrorist versus a civilian, every
        action you see is going to be interpreted through that lens. The operational psychologists reported that
        for these drone operators, it was very difficult to maintain mental resilience and flexibility over such
        long shifts. Their ability to do so was compromised by how long they were there and how tired they were.
        Meanwhile, they have somebody’s life in their hands.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>What’s so interesting about this group of
        people is that they have the bird’s-eye perspective all the time. They view the landscape below through
        that distant perspective. But does that automatically offer them a clear view? Only if they are aware
        not solely of what they are viewing below them, but also of their own mental model.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Most of us, of course, aren’t military drone
        operators. We still need to be able to surveil our own mind. The stories we make up about other people’s
        intentions and motivations can do a lot of damage. They can derail a friendship. They can cause
        political divisiveness. They can even start wars.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>This highlights the most important feature of
        going to the distanced perspective: the most important thing to include in the scope of your viewing is
      </span><span class="calibre4">your own mind.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>It’s one thing to practice decentering in your
        formal practice; being able to actually do it in your life, and under tough circumstances, requires
        using your attention in a different way altogether. In order to intervene in your own cognitive
        processes when they get off-track, you need to realize that you require intervention. In other words:
        the first critical step to </span><span class="calibre4">dropping the story</span><span> is to know that
        you </span><span class="calibre4">have</span><span> one. And that is one of the most challenging

    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>When a bushfire starts in the Australian
        wilderness, it can grow quickly, decimating wildlife and racing toward population centers. It needs to
        be contained before it gets out of control. But much of the Australian bush is difficult to reach,
        inaccessible by road or any other form of land-based route. Specialized firefighters must be sent in by
        helicopter, where they rappel directly into the wildfire area. These rappel crews land right smack in
        the middle of a dynamic, dangerous, and rapidly changing situation. Job descriptions for roles like
        these—like “smoke jumpers” in the US—often explicitly state that you must not only be in excellent
        physical condition, but also </span><span class="calibre4">possess a high degree of emotional stability
        and mental alertness.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Steven is a heli-rappeller who visited my lab
        all the way from Australia, driven to seek our help because of a recent incident. He and his fellow crew
        members were deployed to a particularly challenging terrain in the Australian bush to contain a blaze
        that threatened to grow out of control. Weighed down with heavy gear—each carried a personal kit with
        hand tools like rakes and shovels and firefighting equipment—they fanned out, each taking a sector; a
        support helicopter would soon arrive to drop foam or water from the air. Steven began working on a
        section of fire right in front of him. He was very focused and meticulous in his methodology. And then
        he heard a distinctive sound behind him, a roar like the loudest vacuum, the sound of the air being
        sucked up—the sound of the fire taking over. He was being engulfed by a wall of fire approaching from
        behind.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Now, firefighting rappel crews—along with
        first responders, pilots, health care teams, military personnel, judges, lawyers, and a broad range of
        leaders across various fields—are often highly trained in situational awareness. Situational awareness
        training in these professions usually takes the form of a decision-making model—a way to make sure that
        the choices you make in fast-moving circumstances are based on your real-time, present-moment
        observations, as well as your knowledge and experience, and are of course in service of your goal.
        Steven’s goal was to </span><span class="calibre4">control the fire</span><span>, which he was actively
        working toward; under pressure and surrounded by salient distractors, he had exquisite focus. His
        attention was strongly deployed to the fire he was fighting to control. And his training had involved
        simulating and practicing this </span><span class="calibre4">exact</span><span> scenario. But in that
        moment, something critical was missing.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>In the </span><a href="#epubfile12"
        style="text-decoration:none"><span class="calibre1">previous chapter</span></a><span>, we talked about
        how we use </span><span class="calibre4">simulations</span><span> to arrive at a mental model. We
      </span><span class="calibre4">perceive, process, predict;</span><span> this allows us to </span><span
        class="calibre4">decide, act, communicate.</span><span> These steps aren’t typically linear, but instead
        dynamic and interactive: </span><a name="epubbookmark162"></a><span>Simulations create mental models
        that lead to decisions, which then influence the next simulation, and so on. This is a shifting, fluid,
        constantly unfolding process, not a static one. </span><span class="calibre4">Dropping the
        story</span><span>, then, is not a single action, but rather an </span><span class="calibre4">ongoing
        process—</span><span>one that requires you to become aware, over and over, of what’s happening not only
        around you, but also </span><span class="calibre4">inside your own mind.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Steven got so focused on putting out that
        smaller fire right in front of him that he stopped monitoring the larger fire event. In cognitive
        psychology, </span><a name="epubbookmark163"></a><span>we call this </span><span class="calibre4">goal
        neglect</span><span>: a failure to execute the demands of a particular task, even though you can recall
        the instructions. He </span><span class="calibre4">knew</span><span> that his broader mission was to
        monitor an unpredictable situation that could unfold in any number of ways, but he still got overly
        focused and lost track of the main goal.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Obviously, Steven lived to tell the tale—he
        was able to successfully navigate his way out of danger. However, the close call lingered with him. He
        started using the story to train new firefighters, to communicate that even with impeccable preparation,
        their situational awareness could still be incomplete. He now tells them that </span><span
        class="calibre4">situational</span><span> awareness isn’t enough. Surveilling the external
        landscape—even if you do it well, and mindfully, and with your attention in the present moment—isn’t
        enough.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>Beyond Situational Awareness</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Steven faced a particularly challenging
        instance—a high-demand situation that also required close-field focus. And yet, you don’t have to be
        rappelling into a literal wildfire to experience something like goal neglect and to suffer because of
        it. Think of any time you’ve drifted off course from an important goal—and remember that </span><span
        class="calibre4">goals</span><span> show up in our lives in different ways. We could be talking about
        something at work: you get focused on one aspect of a project and sidetracked, losing sight of how it
        fits into the larger mission of your organization. We could even be talking about parenting.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>My daughter, Sophie, gently summoned me to her
        room one night, frustrated. She was stuck on a particularly difficult math problem. She asked for my
        help.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I went in and sat down next to her and took a
        look at the problem. I started by trying to talk her through it, asking, “Okay, tell me what the problem
        is saying,” and other leading questions. But I was confused, too—I couldn’t quite remember how to tackle
        this particular formula. </span><span class="calibre4">I should know this!</span><span> I felt a surge
        of determination. And for the next forty-five minutes I worked furiously on the problem, completely
        driven: </span><span class="calibre4">I’m going to dominate this math problem. I am going to crush
        sixth-grade math!</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>It worked: I solved the problem! I looked up
        triumphantly—to see Sophie leaning back in her chair, reading a book.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span class="calibre4">Oops.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>My goal, always, is to raise independent,
        self-motivated kids who can problem-solve on their own. When I sat down next to my daughter and started
        talking her through the problem, that was absolutely my mission. I rapidly got sidetracked, even though
        I </span><span class="calibre4">felt</span><span> focused and on-task.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>One of the reasons we get sidetracked in
        moments like these is that it feels good. You see a smaller goal you can accomplish—</span><span
        class="calibre4">put out that fire; solve this problem</span><span>—and you lose awareness of your
        larger purpose: </span><span class="calibre4">control the unfolding fire event; raise an independent
        thinker.</span><span> Solving that math problem was very satisfying for me, but as soon as I looked up I
        realized, </span><span class="calibre4">This is not the best use of my energy with my
        child</span><span>. Certainly a good realization, but how much better would it have been to catch those
        moments earlier, </span><span class="calibre4">before</span><span> I sank most of an hour into the task?
      </span><span class="calibre4">Before</span><span> the wall of fire raged up behind you?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Of course, we want to be able to focus. And we
        started this book by working on that important skill. But we also need to be able to pull out of focus
        when necessary—to be intentional about how and when we focus, and on what. In that moment I was
      </span><span class="calibre4">highly</span><span> focused—completely immersed, in fact. If you’d walked into
        that room, you’d have thought I had no problem with attention. The problem: this wasn’t a time for me to
        be highly focused. I lost track of that, and I lost track of what my mind was up to. I was off course
        and completely unaware of it.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>So here is the next major way that we go
        wrong: We </span><span class="calibre4">are</span><span> paying attention. But our attention is too
        narrow or too wide, too stable or too unstable. You’re paying attention in some way successfully—but
        it’s not </span><span class="calibre4">appropriate for the moment.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>To correct that, you need </span><span
        class="calibre4">meta-awareness.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>Surveilling the Inner Landscape</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><a name="epubbookmark164"></a><span>Meta-awareness is
        the ability to take explicit note of and monitor the current contents or processes of your conscious
        experience. Basically, it’s an awareness of your awareness. When I say “pay attention to your
        attention,” what I mean is apply your meta-awareness. That day in the Australian bush, Steven was
        focused on the fire. But paying attention to his attention would have offered something more: the
        realization that he was fixated on it and needed to expand his attention.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>If situational awareness in high-demand
        professions means “surveilling the external landscape,” then you can think of meta-awareness like this:
        situational awareness for the internal landscape.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>My colleague and friend Scott Rogers, whom
        I’ve been working with for the past decade to bring mindfulness training to all different types of
        populations, is a wizard at describing meta-awareness. It can be a tough concept to grasp, but Scott has
        a knack for coming up with phrases that really make difficult mindfulness concepts more easily
        accessible. When we worked with the University of Miami football team, he put it this way: “You are
        scanning the field.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>He asked the players to picture the football
        field and all the dynamic elements that go into it: the sidelines, the goal lines, the moving players,
        the ball in play, the roar of the crowd, the constant chirping from opposing players, the Jumbotrons in
        every
        corner</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.
        everything. He invited them to think about how they navigate that complex landscape, full of salient
        elements that want to yank at their focus. Then he asked them to visualize their mind the same way: as a
        field, with the same kind of salient moving pieces that might grab your attention and suck it in. He
        suggested that just as players choose how to navigate the football field, and how and when to engage
        other players, they think of the “field” of their mind the same way.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>You can hover above yourself—observe from a
        distance, as we practiced in the </span><a href="#epubfile12" style="text-decoration:none"><span
          class="calibre1">last chapter</span></a><span> with the “Bird’s-Eye View” decentering practice. And
        there are other important cues you can notice, as you build an “awareness of your awareness” that will
        clue you in.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Some of these cues happen in the body. When I
        went into Sophie’s room to help her understand a math problem and instead emerged an hour later a
        heroine in my epic battle with middle school math, I became hyperfocused. I wondered why that had
        happened, when I went in with such a clear goal. As I thought back to the incident, I remembered feeling
        gripped by a desire to win—to “beat” the math problem. I understood that I was driven by the feeling of
        satisfaction I get from “winning,” and that it fueled my hyperfocus. For me, that “gripping” feeling is
        a red flag. I’m much more aware of that sensation now—when I feel it, I check in: Is my attention where
        it needs to be?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>It’s not always a “satisfaction”
        feeling—sometimes we get tripped up and sucked into hyperfocus (or another attentional state that isn’t
        appropriate to the moment) by anxiety, fear, or worry. Sometimes, “seeing” the mind is actually about
        feeling mind-states in the body. These might show up as restlessness in your legs, nervousness in your
        stomach, tension in your jaw. All those years ago, when I lost feeling in my teeth? I was completely
        unaware. That’s why it got so bad. I had no meta-awareness, no sense of what was happening in my mind
        and body, no ability to course-correct until it got to a crisis point.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>With more awareness of my inner landscape,
        these days I am able to intervene earlier and more effectively in my own attention issues. I’m attuned
        to how my mind and body are relating to each other when I’m hyperfocused or stressed. I can notice now
        when I’m starting to clench my jaw; I do a three-minute practice, I take a walk, I relax my mouth—any
        number of things to stop the mindless teeth clenching. And the last time I wrote a grant application on
        a crazy deadline, I knew I wasn’t going to be great at staying meta-aware.
        So</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>. I
        wore a mouth guard. (Sometimes, we just have to accept our limitations!)</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>When I talked to Steven in the lab about his
        instance of “goal neglect,” he described feeling “enticed” by putting out the small fire—that’s what led
        to his hyperfocus. Now, he watches for (as he calls it) “that delicious satisfaction feeling” in his
        upper arms and stomach. That’s what tips him off that he may be sinking into hyperfocus. He can respond
        by broadening his attention as needed.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>He described meta-awareness, from a
        firefighter’s perspective, as “watchstanding”: taking a position where you can see what’s happening more
        clearly. That’s an important part of what having a peak mind really means: it’s being able to get that
        “peak” perspective and take in the entire landscape of your mind. With meta-awareness, we are aware of
        the current contents of our conscious experience, and we monitor to see if those contents are aligned
        with our goals. We’re asking ourselves:</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>What am I perceiving?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>How am I processing it?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>And is the form my attention is taking aligned
        with my goals?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>It’s easy to confuse meta-awareness with
        another thought process we call </span><span class="calibre4">metacognition</span><span>. The difference
        is this: Metacognition is thoughts about how you think. It’s knowing that you have certain mental
        tendencies. Metacognition is, in part, self-awareness. “I have a tendency to assume the worst,” is an
        example of metacognition. Or: “I take a long time making decisions.” Metacognition is certainly
        helpful—this kind of incisive self-awareness of your own cognitive tendencies can clearly support you.
        But it’s not the same as meta-awareness, and it can’t replace it. While you might know that you tend to
        think in certain ways, that doesn’t mean you’ll be able to be aware of problems as they’re happening.
        When you’re mind-wandering and simulating, it doesn’t matter if you’re the most “metacognitively” savvy
        person on the planet—you’ll still get caught up in these mental processes in the moment.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>You’re Unaware that You’re Unaware</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><a name="epubbookmark165"></a><span>We brought 143
        undergraduate students into the lab to test their </span><span class="calibre4">awareness</span><span>
        of their own mind-wandering. We knew people were mind-wandering about 50 percent of the time, but did
        they realize it? We gave them a standard “working memory task”: remember two faces, compare them to a
        test face, do this multiple times over a twenty-minute period. We tracked their accuracy and speed as
        usual, but this time we stopped them in the middle of the test at various points and asked two
        questions: How “on-task” were you—very, somewhat, or not at all? And how </span><span
        class="calibre4">aware</span><span> were you of it?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The results? There were four main clusters of
        responses: (1) reports that participants were </span><span class="calibre4">on-task</span><span> and
      </span><span class="calibre4">aware</span><span> of it; (2) reports that they were </span><span
        class="calibre4">on-task</span><span> and </span><span class="calibre4">unaware</span><span> (this would
        look like a deeply immersed “flow state”); (3) reports that they were </span><span
        class="calibre4">off-task</span><span> and </span><span class="calibre4">aware</span><span> (choosing
        not to pay attention anymore because they thought the task was boring, which researchers call “tuning
        out”); and (4) reports that they were </span><span class="calibre4">off-task</span><span> and
      </span><span class="calibre4">unaware</span><span> (“zoning out”).</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>In addition to all these response clusters, we
        found that participants’ performance got worse and worse, they mind-wandered more and more, and they
        became less meta-aware over the twenty-minute task.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The drop in performance over the course of the
        twenty minutes was not surprising—we’ve already discussed the </span><span class="calibre4">vigilance
        decrement</span><span>: performance gets worse over time when continuous attention is required on a
        task. What these results pointed out is that mind-wandering was increasing as performance was getting
        worse. When we first talked about mind-wandering, we talked about all the evolutionary reasons the brain
        might be “wired to wander,” like opportunity costs, scanning, looking for something better to do, and so
        forth. </span><a name="epubbookmark166"></a><span>The human brain may simply be designed to cyclically
        pull away from the task-at-hand. We are </span><span class="calibre4">built</span><span> to have these
        cyclical patterns in our attention. And that might be fine—if you can notice the pulling away. But what
        we found here is that </span><span class="calibre4">we do not notice.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>This is what the meta-awareness responses
        conveyed—</span><a name="epubbookmark167"></a><span>as mind-wandering was going up, meta-awareness was
        going down. We are mind-wandering more and more over time, and growing less and less able to catch
        ourselves doing it. And when we don’t catch ourselves, we cannot course-correct to get attention back on
        task.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I started this book by telling you that you
        spend 50 percent of your time mind-wandering, and that’s true—that statistic has held up across many
        studies. It’s easy to conclude, looking at that number, that mind-wandering lies at the root of our
        problems with attention. The surprise, though—from this study and others—is that mind-wandering itself
        may not be the real culprit. After all, there are plenty of instances where it’s fine to wander. Think
        of how you allow your thoughts to roam while watching your child’s or grandchild’s favorite movie for
        the third time, or while doing something automatic and easy, like vacuuming a room—“tuning out,” on
        purpose, as opposed to “zoning out.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The difference? </span><span
        class="calibre4">Meta-awareness.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>With tuning out, meta-awareness of the
        situation lets you make sure that your current behavior is aligned with task goals before you decide to
        shift your attention away—no adjustments of attention are needed. </span><a name="epubbookmark168"></a><span>But
        if the task demands suddenly rise, and performance starts slipping,
        attentional resources will be diverted back to the task-at-hand. Your own mind cues you—you don’t need
        an external cue, which, as we know, usually come too late anyway. Without meta-awareness, no monitoring
        occurs—no noticing of the task demands growing, no noticing of the current state of attention, and no
        redirection of attention.</span></p>

        unwelcome events in my life.” She was going through a divorce. Her children were teenagers, “with all
        that that entails,” she says now, with a sigh.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“I was in a complete mental battle with my
        ‘now,’” she says. “I didn’t want it. I was judgmental with myself, with others; I was mad at the
        universe. I was at the mercy of repetitive thoughts. And I was trying to work through it all. I had to
        go to court and make all these decisions—decisions that affected people. Meanwhile, there’s this
        constant rat race of thoughts in my head. I was exhausted by it.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Chris and I met at a conference for female
        judges where we were both panelists invited to speak on the topic of mindfulness and judging. We shook
        hands waiting backstage before the event. Chris joked that attendance might be sparse, that we’d only
        have the other panelists as our audience—would anybody come to a panel on mindfulness and judging?
        Perhaps it was too niche a topic for the judiciary world. But when we walked on stage to take our places
        at the table, the cavernous room was packed with people. Every one of the five hundred seats was filled;
        women were standing in a crowd at the back of the great ballroom. It appeared there was indeed a need
        for mindfulness in judging.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>A courtroom is actually the perfect example of
        a space where you would need both </span><span class="calibre4">situational awareness</span><span> and
      </span><span class="calibre4">meta-awareness.</span><span> Sitting on the bench, Chris is required to engage
        and sustain multiple types of attention. There’s a lawyer questioning a witness the judge must attend
        to. Meanwhile, the judge is holding in mind the testimonies she’s just heard, the laws that apply to the
        facts of the case, and the rules and standards that govern what the lawyer is saying in the moment: she
        is listening to what is being said, while being ready to respond if the opposing lawyer objects (will
        she sustain or overrule?). At the same time, she’s monitoring </span><span class="calibre4">other</span><span>
        people’s attention: Is that juror in the back row asleep? Is the
        court reporter keeping up? Judge McAliley needs to make sure that every word is captured, so if the
        reporter looks harried, she should slow things down. There might be an interpreter she needs to be aware
        of, as well; there might be a baby crying in the gallery.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“There is so much to attend to,” she says,
        “and then on top of it, there’s your </span><span class="calibre4">own mind</span><span> to attend to.
        If the lawyer is making his closing arguments, and I’m thinking about my divorce, or what I want for
        lunch, I’m not doing a good job. I’m not there! And it’s consequential.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>She needs an awareness of what’s going on in
        the courtroom </span><span class="calibre4">and</span><span> what’s going on in her mind. Mindfulness
        training has given Chris greater insight into the kind of stuff that gets her off-track. Frustration,
        anxiousness, worry—they all show up in the body. She often does a mini-practice in the courtroom:
      </span><span class="calibre4">be still, sense the body, sense the breath.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“I have to get below my neck,” she says. “It’s
        so amazing, to notice what happens to the body when we have emotional feelings. We ignore them, but
        there’s great information there.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>For her, these feelings will show up as
        anxiousness or frustration—the lawyers don’t seem prepared; she notices her own voice rising; she
        realizes she’s been ruminating. </span><span class="calibre4">Should I call them out for not being
        prepared? What impact will that have on them, or on the case, or on the defendant?</span><span>
        Mindfulness practice has helped her use her own emotions as information.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“This is supposed to be a rational system,”
        she says, “so I don’t want my emotions—without my understanding or decision—to lead me to a decision.
        But I’m a judge, not a robot. I need to be able to experience emotion and be informed by
        it</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.
        not ruled by it.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span class="calibre4">Meta-awareness</span><span>
        allows her an awareness and understanding not only of her own thoughts and emotions, but also of her
        implicit biases. It’s something she has to think about in every case. If there’s a police officer
        testifying against a previously convicted felon, Chris asks herself: What are her personal assumptions?
        What’s her drop-down menu of biases when it comes to gender, profession, class, race? Can she notice
        them, but not be constrained by them?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“A lot of this practice is simply trying to
        notice our assumptions in life,” she says. “When you actually pay attention to them, you understand:
        they are </span><span class="calibre4">rapid-fire.</span><span>”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>For her, the big revelation was paying
        attention </span><span class="calibre4">without judgment.</span><span> Without judgment of herself, or
        of others, or of circumstances. Ironic, because </span><span class="calibre4">judging</span><span> is
        quite literally Chris’s profession. But being able to </span><span class="calibre4">pay attention to the
        present moment, without judgment or elaboration,</span><span> is what now allows her to be more
        effective when she’s making decisions that shape people’s lives.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“It’s such a privilege to be a judge,” she
        remarks. “Our society picks people like me to resolve disputes. I’m sitting there, hearing people
        testify to completely opposite versions of events, and it’s my job to determine who’s credible.
        Sometimes it’s clear, but sometimes it’s not. And I have to try to get it right.”</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>Why It Works</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>In the lab, it’s really hard to “see”
        meta-awareness directly through people’s behavior alone. So (as in the working memory study I mentioned
        above) we have to give people attention and working memory tasks </span><span class="calibre4">and</span><span>
        ask them to then self-report on it. </span><a name="epubbookmark170"></a><span>Study after study shows that the
        more </span><span class="calibre4">aware</span><span> people are of where their attention is, the better their
        performance
        is. We also know that when they are more aware, they can catch themselves mind-wandering (without being
        asked). And </span><a name="epubbookmark171"></a><span>we know that some things cause meta-awareness to
        tank—like cigarette cravings and drinking alcohol.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>With experienced mindfulness practitioners—and
        even with people who’ve taken an eight-week mindfulness-based stress reduction class—we see something
        else, too: </span><a name="epubbookmark172"></a><span class="calibre4">reduced default mode
        activity.</span><span> You remember what that is: reduced activity in the brain network, sometimes
        called the “me” network, that’s most involved during internal attention, self-focus, mental simulations,
        and mind-wandering. Why would mindfulness training, compared to no training or some comparison training,
        reduce default mode activity? As we’ve discussed, there is growing evidence that mindfulness training
        increases attention and decentering, and decreases mind-wandering. Mental simulations that can hijack
        attention are less frequent and less capable of keeping you locked-in. But all of this may hinge on
        mindfulness training’s power to increase meta-awareness.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>When you’re meta-aware, you’re looking at
        yourself. You’re the object! You can’t be simultaneously immersed in self-related thinking
        (mind-wandering, simulating) </span><span class="calibre4">and</span><span> reflecting on the self. This
        is why, as meta-awareness goes up, mind-wandering goes down. It makes sense that these would be
        antagonistic processes: the self can’t be outside and inside at the same time. Think back to the
        decentering technique you practiced in the </span><a href="#epubfile12" style="text-decoration:none"><span
          class="calibre1">previous chapter</span></a><span>, which asked you
        to step outside, or “de-fuse,” from the self for a moment. You were already practicing meta-awareness in
        that moment—now, we need to be able to do it even more often, as a mental habit.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We want greater
        meta-awareness</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.
        and mindfulness practice is what gets us there.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span class="calibre6">Noticing</span><span>: Your
        Attentional Powerup</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Think back to your first time doing a
        mindfulness exercise, like </span><span class="calibre4">Find Your Flashlight</span><span>. You might
        have been surprised at how much your attention moved around. Attention is like a ball in motion. To
        effectively dribble it, you have to keep engaging and reengaging it over and over. If you “zone out”
        (mind-wander without realizing it), the ball will roll away. And the ball rolls away often. You only
        become meta-aware when you completely lose the ball: You walk out of a meeting and realize you have no
        idea what has been said. During an important conversation, you hear someone ask “Are you even
        listening?” and you realize you’ve been nodding along, but hearing nothing. You hear yourself shout,
        angrily, “I’m NOT angry!” You realize: </span><span class="calibre4">Oops. I’m angry.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>In each of these examples, that moment of
        realization of </span><span class="calibre4">where your attention actually is and what your mind is
        doing—</span><span>that’s meta-awareness. That’s it—that’s what it feels like. Those “meta moments” are
        what we want. But we want them much earlier, when they can truly be effective and protective.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Our goal with mindfulness training is to
      </span><span class="calibre4">increase</span><span> our meta moments so that we can actually execute the
        attentional pivots that are so critical for our success and well-being. Even if you have the strongest
        attention system in the world, you could direct it to the wrong place. To be able to implement any of
        the tactics you’ve been learning, you have to realize that you need to do so.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>In </span><span class="calibre4">The Art of
        War</span><span>, which I used to introduce this book, Sun Tzu offers up a second approach one can use
        in an unfair fight:</span></p>
    <p class="extract" style="margin:12pt 14pt"><a name="epubbookmark173"></a><span>The force applied is minute but
        the results enormous.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Don’t struggle against a brick wall. Find a
        way to apply the minimum amount of force with the maximum amount of impact. The skill we want to
        cultivate is not only the capacity to pay better attention, focus more, concentrate harder: this is
        equivalent to going to battle and training for the fight—helpful but incomplete. We need to build
        something beyond this. We need a </span><span class="calibre4">force multiplier</span><span>, like a
        power-up in a video game. The attentional force multiplier you need to acquire is your capacity to be
        meta-aware, to </span><span class="calibre4">notice</span><span>.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>To </span><span
        class="calibre4">notice</span><span> when we are not focused or </span><span class="calibre4">too</span><span>
        focused.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>To </span><span
        class="calibre4">notice</span><span> when we are mentally elsewhere and not in the here and now.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>To </span><span
        class="calibre4">notice</span><span> what is happening around us and within us.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span class="calibre4">Noticing</span><span> is what
        unlocks our capacity to intervene in these pervasive attentional problems.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span class="calibre5">It’s simple: To know if
        you’re getting grabbed by something and need to intervene, you have to be watching.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The good news: You’ve already been practicing
        this the whole time. Meta-awareness has been part of every practice you’ve done so far.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>Meta-Tate</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>In the </span><span class="calibre4">Find Your
        Flashlight</span><span> practice, the moment you noticed that your flashlight had drifted away from
        breath-related sensations—that was meta-awareness. During the </span><span class="calibre4">Watch Your
        Whiteboard</span><span> practice with labeling, when you noticed a thought, feeling, or sensation and
        labeled it—that was meta-awareness. During the decentering practice, when you took the bird’s-eye
        perspective and scanned your mind for biases, simulations, and mental models—that was meta-awareness.
        Even during the body scan, when you directed your attention to a particular bodily sensation, you were
        noticing which sensations were there and becoming aware of mind-wandering.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Up to this point, our goal has been to make
        sure that your attention was on a target object, like your breath. Now, the target of your

      </span><span class="calibre4">is</span><span> your attention.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Ultimately, all the practices you’ve been
        working on in this book will build meta-awareness—and practicing any of them regularly supports your
        ability to </span><span class="calibre4">observe and monitor your own mind.</span><span> This next
        practice is specifically designed to notice the moment-to-moment contents of your conscious experience,
        without getting caught up in the thoughts, emotions, and sensations that arise.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>This is a variation on a traditional “open
        monitoring” practice that asks you to observe the contents of your moment-to-moment conscious experience
      </span><span class="calibre4">without engaging with it.</span><span> While the prior formal practices have
        aimed to cultivate concentrative focus, this practice is instead about having receptive, broad, and
        stable attention.</span></p>

    </div>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I’ll be honest with you: participants often
        report open monitoring to be the most challenging of the core practices. So here’s a way to think about
        what we’re doing in this practice, from an experience I had recently while practicing it myself.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I had set myself up to practice in my living
        room. It was a beautiful autumn day, breezy and warm, and I had all the windows open. My dog was in the
        room with me, lying by the window and gazing out at the street. Tashi is a Lhasa Apso. If you aren’t
        familiar with them, Lhasa Apsos are small dogs with long white hair that sweeps the floor if you don’t
        cut it. I find mine adorable, but I’m willing to acknowledge that they look a little bit like a floor
        mop. Lhasa Apsos came from Tibet and were historically kept in monasteries—their job was to monitor the
        common areas of the monastery and alert the monks of any intruders by barking. And they are </span><span
        class="calibre4">very</span><span> good at barking.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I was a few minutes into my practice when
        Tashi was already yapping at something. He does this all the time—he loves to go and stare out the
        window and then if anybody walks by, he’ll bark. Actually, it doesn’t even have to be a person. It could
        be a car, a squirrel, a small branch falling off a tree—anything will get him going. I tried to forge
        ahead with my practice—after all, I figured, the barking was just a sensation like anything else—but he
        simply would not stop. I was getting </span><span class="calibre4">so</span><span> irritated—and then it
        dawned on me: </span><span class="calibre4">I’m doing the exact same thing that he is.</span><span> I’m
        sitting here, watching for what’s different on my whiteboard. He’s watching for what’s different in that
        rectangle of window available to him—that’s exactly what open monitoring is! Sure, maybe I’m not
        actually </span><span class="calibre4">barking</span><span> at stuff, but it’s kind of the same thing.
        Tashi barks when he notices something, while I might get stuck and emotionally reactive about something
        I notice. I got up and closed the curtain. He stopped barking and lay down.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We can’t just “close the curtain” on our
        thoughts. We also can’t sit at the window and bark at every passing thing. But we </span><span
        class="calibre4">can</span><span> learn to notice it—and let it go.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>My dog doesn’t have that ability—but you do!
        Think of it this way: Would you run outside to talk to every person who walks by your house? No. So
        treat the thoughts that arise for you throughout the day in the same way. You can’t stop them from
        coming any more than you can stop people from walking down your street. But you </span><span
        class="calibre4">can</span><span> change the way that you interact with them. You can decide when to
        engage with them, and when not to, and instead allow them to pass by.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>Using “Choice Points” to Improve Your Practice</span>
    </p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>When offering the president of the University
        of Miami and his leadership cabinet MBAT, the program my colleague Scott Rogers and I codeveloped for
        high-demand professionals, we set up shop in a conference room. After a bit of discussion, we got into
        the practices. We had been working with this group regularly, and were in the part of the program that
        introduced them to the open monitoring practice.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We all took a seated Mountain Pose, and we
        talked them through “watching mental content pass, like clouds in the sky.” At a certain point before
        beginning the formal practice, one member of the group loudly sighed.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“This noise is driving me crazy!” she said.
        Indeed, the air conditioner was making a persistent, irregular rattle. “I don’t think I can do this
        practice with this thing going. It’s </span><span class="calibre4">so</span><span> irritating!”</span>
    </p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>She was right—the air conditioner </span><span
        class="calibre4">was</span><span> very hard to ignore. It was also a great opportunity to point out why
        engaging in open monitoring practice can be helpful for precisely these types of irritating, annoying,
        or anger-provoking moments in our lives: we can recognize </span><span class="calibre4">choice
        points.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I conveyed to the group that I didn’t know her
        direct experience in that moment, but I have similarly been irritated by annoying sounds during my
        practice on other occasions. If I could have watched her mental whiteboard, or mine, in such moments,
        here’s what I might have seen: A sound was noticed—a sensory experience registered on the mental
        whiteboard. Then, a concept showed up—the thought </span><span class="calibre4">It’s so
        irritating.</span><span> Next, an emotion—</span><span class="calibre4">feeling</span><span> that
        irritation. And finally, the expression of emotion aloud—“It’s so irritating!”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>It may feel a bit contrived to break it down
        as a linear sequence—sensation, thought, emotion, action—especially when it feels so packed together,
        like a big jumble of irritation. But as we learn to watch what is unfolding in our minds with a practice
        like open monitoring, we can see the sequence of mental events flowing by with greater precision and
        granularity. And we may notice the small gaps between events—where we are making choices. Linking the
        sensory experience of the sound with the concept of </span><span class="calibre4">irritating</span><span> is a
        choice. Feeling irritation is a choice. Expressing that
        feeling is also a choice.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>With practice, we get better at noticing
        mental events and identifying opportunities to intervene—to make </span><span
        class="calibre4">different</span><span> choices. Think of instances in your own life when your reaction
        felt ballistically driven by an instigating event, like getting cut off in traffic and flipping someone
        off. It may seem very difficult to break down such episodes to see choice points. But we can get better
        at this, and open monitoring practice helps. It tunes up our meta-awareness. With more practice, we
        might even be able to experience events as spacious, appreciating the infinite possibilities before us
        in any moment. My favorite expression of this insight comes from Velvet Underground front man Lou Reed:
        “Between thought and expression lies a lifetime.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>There wasn’t anything we could do about the
        sound—we couldn’t adjust the thermostat to turn it off, and there really wasn’t time to try to find
        someone to fix it. The sound was going to be there as we tried to practice. However, thinking about our
        experience of it in terms of choice points, noticing the space between the thought and expression,
        offered an opportunity: when the thought </span><span class="calibre4">This is so
        irritating</span><span> occurs, you can make a different choice. Instead of feeling and then expressing
        anger, you could choose not to hang onto it. Just let it fade and allow your whiteboard to remain
        “receptive” to whatever arises next.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Whether it’s a thought tied to the rattling of
        an air conditioner or a fear or worry that loudly presents itself in your mind, you can use this same
        strategy. Thoughts, memories, and anxieties may appear in the mind unbidden. We can remember that we
        have a choice on what we do next. Think of Tashi, and make a different choice. No need to bark: let them
        walk on by.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><a name="epubbookmark174"></a><span>There is a
        concept in Buddhism called the “Second Arrow.” It comes from a famous parable: the Buddha asked one of
        his students, “If you are struck by an arrow, does it hurt?”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“Yes!” the student replied.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“If you are struck by a second arrow,” the
        Buddha asked, “does it hurt even more?”</span></p>

    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The Buddha explained: In life, we can’t
        control whether we’re hit by an arrow or not. But the second arrow is our </span><span
        class="calibre4">reaction</span><span> to the first. The first arrow causes pain—the second arrow is our
        distress about that pain.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I love this parable because it very simply
        encapsulates the connection between mindfulness and attention: The first arrow happens. There are arrows
        every day. But the second arrow—your response to the first—is what sucks up your attentional bandwidth.
        And that </span><span class="calibre4">is</span><span> within your control. This is another choice point
        you can access—if you have an awareness of your own mind.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Choice points become especially important in
        another arena: </span><span class="calibre4">relationships.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Whether an interaction you’re having is with a
        loved one, someone you’ve just met, or a nemesis, the “packaged” story you’re carrying in your working

        flow</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.
        not only between you and this other person, but also with others. The ripple effects of our
        relationships, and whether they’re effective, compassionate, and communicative or closed off and full of
        misunderstandings, can have a far reach.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><a name="epubbookmark175"></a><span>One important
        node in the brain network for meta-awareness is located at the very front of the prefrontal cortex—it
        also happens to be part of the brain network for social connection. It’s activated when we are
        meta-aware and also when we connect with others by simulating their reality and seeing things from their
        point of view. Meta-awareness offers us a window into our own minds as if we are watching it from
        someone else’s perspective, but it also allows us insight into others. Using your attention, you can not

    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>When Congressman Tim Ryan of Ohio invited me to
        travel to Washington, DC, to share our research on mindfulness training for active-duty service members,
        I immediately thought of Major Jason Spitaletta and Major Jeff Davis, the Marines I’d met back when they
        were both captains, during our very first study on mindfulness in the military. Jason was the one who’d
        warned “This is never going to work,” but who’d then thrown himself wholeheartedly into practice. Jeff,
        who was attentionally hijacked while on that bridge in Florida, says that mindfulness practice “saved
        his life.” I asked them to join me for the meeting with Congressman Ryan.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We met up outside a Metro stop near the
        National Mall. I hadn’t seen them in years, but they were as boisterous as I remembered, and launched
        right into catching me up on their lives. Jason, who had been midway through a PhD program in psychology
        when he deployed to Iraq, was so impacted by the mindfulness study he participated in with us that he
        changed his research focus when he returned. He was now studying </span><span class="calibre4">distress
        tolerance</span><span>—the ability to withstand aversive mental states. Jeff, now retired from the
        military, was pursuing his MBA at George Washington University. Their lively stories, zigzagging from
        training in Florida and grad school in DC to deploying to Baghdad, both captivated and transported me.
        Before I knew it, I was looking straight ahead at that iconic white building, the US Capitol. And then I
        noticed something odd. People were peering in our direction. At one point, two women in business suits
        powerwalking our way just stopped and stared right at us from across the street. What was going
        on?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I turned around, curious to see who might be
        behind us. No one. Jason laughed and said, “They think we’re your Secret Service detail.” Jeff chimed
        in, “Amishi, they’re trying to figure out who </span><span class="calibre4">you</span><span> are.” The
        sight of two brawny dudes in sport coats flanking a 5'2″ Indian woman was apparently odd enough to draw
        attention, even in DC. For the rest of our walk up Independence Avenue, they did not hold back razzing
        me about my “terrible situational awareness.” I had to take it on the chin.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We made our way to the congressman’s office in
        the Rayburn Building, and were led right in to see him.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“Please call me Tim,” Congressman Ryan said,
        towering over me as he shook my hand.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>From the moment we all sat down together, I
        was struck by Tim’s full and unwavering attention. He was direct and probing, wanting to know about
        Jason’s and Jeff’s military experience, their journey with mindfulness, and thoughts on how mindfulness
        could be made more accessible to both active-duty and veteran service members. We discussed the results
        from the study with their unit and my lab’s ongoing research efforts. Twenty minutes later, a staffer
        knocked on his office door.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“They’re calling a vote on the House floor,”
        she said.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Soon after he disappeared from his office, Tim
        reappeared on the wall-mounted TV screen, delivering a short yet impassioned speech on trade. Then, in
        no time at all, he was back with us, excited to continue our discussion.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>What stood out most that day was when Tim
        described the value of mindfulness practice in his own life. He humbly acknowledged that the battles he
        faced in DC were nothing like those that Jason and Jeff had endured during their military deployments.
        He conveyed that he had come to lean heavily on his daily mindfulness practice as </span><span
        class="calibre4">mental armor</span><span>. And it showed—his commitment to serving the public good was
        contagious.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>On my flight back to Miami, many thoughts
        bubbled up. The congressman’s capacity to make us feel motivated, heard, and understood—even while he
        juggled other critical responsibilities—was remarkable. I hadn’t earlier made the connection that,
        exactly like warriors and first responders, leaders’ pressures and demands eat away at the very
        qualities they need most. Tim had learned for himself that clarity, connection, and compassion were
        trainable, and he trained daily. How, I wondered, could we get these tools to other leaders? How could
        we study their effects? As the plane landed, I felt energized—it was time to get back to work.</span>

    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>During the COVID-19 pandemic, guidelines from
        the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have constantly encouraged Americans to practice social
        distancing, keeping at least six feet of distance between ourselves and others to limit the spread of
        the highly contagious and potentially deadly SARS-CoV-2 virus. As many social psychologists were quick
        to point out, “social distancing” is a misnomer. More important for our physical and psychological
        health is that we remain </span><span class="calibre4">physically</span><span> distant while staying
      </span><span class="calibre4">socially</span><span> connected.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>As human beings, we need social connection
        from infancy, and we’ll keep needing it for the rest of our lives. I’m not being dramatic when I say
        that without social connection we die </span><span class="calibre4">faster</span><span>. </span><a
        name="epubbookmark177"></a><span>Loneliness and social isolation are risk factors for poor health as
        well as accelerated mortality. Social connection has been scientifically studied for decades across
        multiple fields and many perspectives, ranging from mother-child bonding and romantic attachment to team
        dynamics and social networks. And </span><span class="calibre4">attention</span><span> is one of the
        fundamental building blocks for all social relationships: it’s what shapes our moment-to-moment
        interactions with other people. In fact, the Latin root for the word “attention” is </span><span
        class="calibre4">attendere</span><span>, which means “to stretch toward.” In this sense, attention is
        connection.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Imagine yourself speaking to someone on the
        phone. If the cell phone signal is glitchy, perceptual details will be lost. If you get distracted, your
        attention may be diverted. You’ll have both a poor mental model and poor situational awareness of the
        conversation.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><a name="epubbookmark178"></a><span>Conversations
        rely on </span><span class="calibre4">shared mental models</span><span>. These are cocreated by both
        speakers, and dynamically updated as the conversation progresses. So, on your imagined call: lousy input
        and processing may have led to a lousy shared model, and most likely a lousy experience for you both.
        We’ve all been there! Contrast this with speaking to an attentive and undistracted conversation partner
        on a good cell phone connection. Her words are crisp and clear, her attention is locked on you, and
        there is a long and rich shared history of content and warmth during the call. Under these conditions,
        our shared mental models will be stable and vivid, heightening our feeling of connection. We will feel
        cognitively attuned as we are transported into a (mental) space of our own shared making.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>High-quality interactions require
        high-integrity mental models. And to make them, we need to draw on all our attentional skills:

        class="calibre4">Resisting or correcting</span><span> the pull of salient distractors. </span><span

        you’ve ever used the phrase “not on the same page,” you know what that feels like.) And finally, you
        need that meta-awareness piece to implement it all.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>All the skills we’ve been practicing come into

    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Human interactions are nuanced and complex.
        They can be fun, stress-relieving, entertaining, rewarding, productive. They can also be tense,
        challenging, adversarial. Every day, we have interactions with people that we look forward to, and ones
        we may dread. Yet we have to show up for all of them. And when things go astray with these interactions,
        it can seem as if the problem is insurmountable, or foundational, or maybe “just the way people
        are.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Like so many of the other challenges of

        behavior and working memory capacity found that parents with lower (vs. higher) working memory capacity
        were more likely to engage in verbally or emotionally abusive behavior toward their children.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>In addition, lapses in meta-awareness can get
        us into hot water when it comes to our interactions with others. We can make assumptions and have
        stories (mental models) that are not shared by others or are entirely inaccurate. This can lead to a
        cascade of errors, including wrong-headed decisions and actions. No matter the cause of challenging
        interpersonal interactions, the result will be the same: the interaction is unfulfilling and
        unsatisfying at best, and aversive or damaging at worst.</span></p>

        Reacting</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Some people hear the term “regulation” and
        think “robotic”—that’s not what we mean at all. We mean </span><span class="calibre4">having a
        proportionate response</span><span>. This entails having emotional responses to events that scale with
        what is actually occurring. If somebody bursts into tears because they get fired, I’d call that an
        appropriate, even proportionate response. But if they burst into tears because they spill their coffee?
        Well, something’s up.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We’ve all been there. These moments of
        emotional overwhelm creep up on us, sometimes when we least expect them and aren’t really ready to
        handle them. At work, with our friends, kids, or parents, in romantic relationships—we respond in ways
        we might later regret. We feel out of control, out of proportion, out of sync with events. If you’ve
        felt this way, it’s because you are human—and some of the challenges you face are likely, at least in
        part, attention- and working memory–related</span><span class="calibre4">.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>It’s a tricky paradox: Strong emotions can
        capture our attention, can invade and take over our working memory. They can cause us to dredge up
        off-topic, and sometimes distressing, memories and thoughts; they provide fuel for the “loop of doom.”
        Meanwhile, we need those very same working memory resources to be able to proactively deal with the
        emotions that arise. There’s a “driving down” effect, a kind of negative spiral: poor mood degrades
        working memory, and a degraded working memory causes more poor mood. So how do we pull out of that
        cognitive nose dive?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>To start, you strengthen the capacities that
        will protect against distraction, dysregulation, and disconnection by engaging in mindfulness practice.
        Any of the core practices we’ve already covered will help. And by cultivating meta-awareness, as we
        discussed in the </span><a href="#epubfile13" style="text-decoration:none"><span class="calibre1">previous
          chapter</span></a><span>, we can have higher-quality access to the
        contents and processes at play in our moment-to-moment experiences. We need to be aware of our
      </span><span class="calibre4">emotional state so we can intervene to regulate it, as needed.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>When I first began practicing mindfulness, I
        noticed that having an awareness of my emotional state helped keep my overreactions at bay. And when I
        overreacted (such as yelling loudly out of frustration), I apologized more quickly than I would have
        previously. I wasn’t quite able to prevent the yelling. It bubbled out of me too fast. But I
      </span><span class="calibre4">was</span><span> able to watch the anger rise. I could track it and really
        feel the flushed feeling in my cheeks, the lump in my throat, the tingling in my arms, and then I could
        hear my (too) loud voice, yelling. Seeing this play out may not seem like an improvement, but it was.
        Sure, not yelling in the first place would have been better, and we’ll get to that. Apologizing faster,
        however, meant less distress for me and the person I was yelling at. It also meant that I wouldn’t have
        to follow my yelling with brooding or (internally) shouting at myself for fifteen minutes, regretful of
        my overreaction. To me, being able to apologize faster was a big win. It meant I was on my way. I could
        break the reactivity cycle.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>You can </span><span class="calibre5">change
        the way you orient</span><span> to an experience, even if it initiated an overwhelming emotion. Here’s
        what I mean by that: The other day, I came home very late from a long day at the lab—many back-to-back
        meetings, and a deadline looming the next day that still needed my attention. I felt preoccupied and
        exhausted. And when I walked through the door leading from our garage into the kitchen, I saw something
        that immediately spiked my blood pressure: the blender, still coated in that morning’s smoothie at 9:00
        p.m. and swarming with fruit flies.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>My face got hot. I felt a swell of anger. My
        thoughts went immediately to Michael, my husband, who’d been home with the kids. It would have taken him
        a minute at the most to just rinse the blender out after using it. And I’d talked to him about the
        blender before—it really bothered me, and he’d promised to try to remember. My mind started leaping to
        conclusions: </span><span class="calibre4">He doesn’t really listen to me! He doesn’t really
        care!</span><span> In a matter of seconds, it was about much more than an unwashed blender.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>At this point I had a couple of different
        options: (A) march into his office and yell at my poor husband, (B) suppress my anger and carry on as if
        I were just fine, (C) reappraise the situation, or (D) decenter.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>All these options would have required my
        attention and engaging my working memory, but some more than others. Options B and C especially would.
        And B, suppression, doesn’t work very well long-term—my anger over the blender would likely bubble up in
        some other situation. </span><span class="calibre4">Suppression</span><span> is fueled by executive
        attention and working memory, and it requires these resources to continue to do the suppressing.
      </span><a name="epubbookmark180"></a><span>While you’re actively suppressing, it leaves less cognitive
        bandwidth to do much else.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Which brings us to option C: </span><span
        class="calibre4">reappraisal.</span><span> Reappraisal means changing the way we think about a
        situation, by reevaluating or reinterpreting it in order to change its emotional impact. This is,
        thankfully, what I managed to do. Standing there, looking at those fruit flies dancing around my
        kitchen, I reframed my way of thinking about it: </span><span class="calibre4">Michael has been holding
        down the fort here at the house all day while I’ve been working. He’s had a lot to manage! But the kids
        are healthy, fed, and safe. This is a small blip relative to all that is good right now.</span><span> By
        reappraising, we reduce the intensity of negative emotion, allowing us to take a clearer look at the
        situation and assess whether the impact is as negative as we initially assumed. </span><span
        class="calibre4">This isn’t actually that big of a deal—nothing is ruined or broken. I can just ask him
        to wash the blender, or simply wash it myself.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The strategy I use most often nowadays is
        option D: I </span><span class="calibre4">decenter</span><span>. You can go to the bird’s-eye view, as
        we did earlier, or you can try something even faster: </span><span class="calibre4">stop, drop, and

        confidence that I will have access to more data regarding the situation, am aware of what my story is

        Present</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Lieutenant General Walt Piatt arrived in
        Kirkuk, Iraq, to broker a meeting between three leaders of local tribes that had been in conflict. As
        the newly arrived general from the US, he had to host these three factions and try to find a way
        forward. At one point they had all banded together against one common enemy, ISIS. But now that ISIS was
        gone from the region, they were clashing with each other, and all were furious at the US. The tension in
        that room was—to put it mildly—</span><span class="calibre4">high.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The meeting started like a bonfire, with the
        tension and acrimony building rapidly. The three leaders aired their grievances about each other and
        about the US’s involvement in their region. It might have been easiest to shift quickly into
        problem-solving mode, or even defensiveness. Walt decided that he was going to let them talk. He was
        simply going to listen. He tried to bring all of the attentional presence he had to the moment, to keep
        his focus on each leader as he spoke, to be completely open to what they had to say.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>When each person was finished, he said,
        “Here’s what I hear you saying.” And he repeated back, with precision, what they had just
        expressed.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Walt didn’t solve the big issues that day. He
        didn’t come up with any grand solutions to all the thorny, difficult problems raised in that meeting.
        Yet, something more happened. The entire dynamic changed. The local leaders felt heard, and they felt
        respected.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“You could see it on their faces,” Walt said.
        “You could see them thinking, ‘This is someone we can work with.’”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The meeting ended up being a productive one.
        The three factions were able to talk to each other. And at the end of the meeting, one of the leaders
        approached Walt. He was wearing a strand of prayer beads on his wrist—beautifully decorated with a
        silver inscription. He unlooped it from his arm and handed it to Walt, saying, “This would not have been
        possible without you.” A beautiful gesture of appreciation.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>It’s easy to think of “listening” as a passive
        thing. In fact, it’s quite active and demanding, if you do it well. It takes your attentional control,
        your emotional regulation, and your compassion. It takes focus, meta-awareness, and decentering. It’s
        not passive at all. It’s </span><span class="calibre4">heavy lifting.</span><span> And it’s
        extraordinarily valuable. To listen, really listen, is often the “action” we most urgently need to
        perform. This story of how attention changed the course of a conflict gives me hope. It shows us what
      </span><span class="calibre4">presence—</span><span>so simple, yet so difficult—can actually achieve.</span>

        listen. When you do, you will have more information regarding what to say next: what is most

    </p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>My daughter, Sophie, had a “no homework” night
        from school recently, and when I asked her what she wanted to do with her evening, she said she wanted
        to bake something. But she was specific: she wanted to bake </span><span class="calibre4">with
        me.</span><span> She wouldn’t let my husband help—she banished him from the kitchen. It was going to be
        a mother-daughter baking project, she insisted: just the two of us.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We found a recipe for cookies online and got
        going, spreading all the ingredients out on the counter, greasing the pan, preheating the oven. This
        wasn’t a recipe we’d done before, so I had it pulled up on my phone to check and double-check the
        instructions. Every time I touched my phone, she was upset. “Why are you on your phone?!” she kept
        exclaiming whenever I so much as glanced at it. I was baffled at first—why was she overreacting? Then I
        realized that I’d been exceptionally busy, spending a lot of time with her brother discussing his
        college admissions and summer internship prospects, in addition to several late nights at the lab. It
        was obvious that she felt I hadn’t been available to her.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I felt a pang of guilt and sadness about what
        she might have been feeling these past few weeks before snapping back to the present moment. I asked
        myself two important questions: What was needed right now, and what mattered? Baking these cookies with
        her, both of us together, that’s what mattered. What could I do right now for what mattered most? Give
        her my full focus. It was all she wanted. Later that evening, after too many cookies had been consumed
        and Sophie was in bed, I reflected on how this evening might have unfolded differently when I was in the
        midst of my attention crisis—when I was far less attuned, less receptive to all that was happening
        around me. I would have likely missed what Sophie needed from me, and if I had figured it out, I’m not
        sure I could have given her what she needed. </span><span class="calibre4">I</span><span> didn’t even
        have my full focus, which meant I certainly didn’t have it to give.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>What was different now? It felt like my mind
        was more present-centered, available, and pliable. I smiled, realizing: </span><span class="calibre4">this is
        what a peak mind feels like.</span><span> To me, a peak mind is not about
        perfection or being at some imaginary pinnacle, like you might see on a “successory” poster: woman on
        mountaintop, arms flung in the air relishing her peak experience. A peak mind is not about striving to
        get somewhere else. It’s simpler, more elegant, and doable. I think of it like a triangle: the base is
        the present moment, and the sides are two forms of attention—one side, receptive attention so we can
        notice, observe, and be, and the other side, concentrative attention so we are focused and
        flexible.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Attention, both its receptive and
        concentrative forms, is not only a precious brain resource—it’s a currency, one of our most valuable
        currencies. The people in our lives notice what, where, and who we spend it on. Attention, in a lot of
        ways, is our highest form of love.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>In addition to attention, for us to fully
        connect with another person requires a unique and complex set of skills. Many of the moments of
        connection we want to show up for are positive and loving, but we also need to show up for those
        interactions that are difficult or adversarial. A whole spectrum of human relationships exists out
        there, and some of them are exceedingly difficult to navigate.</span></p>

        communication consultant, made a life-altering decision: she was going to run for mayor. She enjoyed her
        work running her own company, and she loved applying her skills, like critical thinking and empathy, to
        solving complex problems. Sara saw a lot of issues in her community—Jackson, Wyoming (commonly known as
        Jackson Hole), which is adjacent to the tourist meccas of Grand Teton and Yellowstone National Parks.
        Jackson had one of the highest socioeconomic divides in the nation, and with that came issues of high
        rates of depression and substance abuse, homelessness, high stress, and more. Sara thought she might be
        able to make a difference through her leadership and by influencing policy. She felt passionate about
        trying to move the needle from inside the system. Her goal, she says now, was to “infiltrate positions

        her opponent had run clean, straightforward campaigns. This time, her opponent went negative. She had to
        decide, every day, how to respond to rhetorical attacks. She would get up every morning and do a
        mindfulness practice, first thing. No phone, no news, no social media. She says the practice “gave my
        brain rest” and allowed her time to ground herself in “what really mattered to me.” She’d decided early
        on in her campaign that she wasn’t going to “go dirty,” and she held to it—even when she lost.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>She jokes now that she went into her two-year
        term as mayor saying, “I love people!” and came out saying, “I hate people!” In all seriousness, though,
        she feels her time in office was valuable to her and that she </span><span class="calibre4">was</span><span>
        able to move the needle—even though it was a painful, difficult, even
        disillusioning time. Her mindfulness practice threw her, she says, “a lifeline,” in large part because
        of the way it helped her connect with others and get things done—especially when those interactions were
        adversarial and fraught with conflict.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Thorny or difficult encounters with others can
        become situations where emotional reactivity gets the better of us. Or we try to escape, and find the
        quickest way out of the interaction. Neither strategy is great for attention or psychological health in
        the long term: unresolved issues, questions, and doubts become conflict states that draw your thoughts
        into ruminative loops. And interpersonal strife can also drain attention—disabling us from navigating a
        tough situation gracefully or productively.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“It’s heartbreaking to see the kind of
        suffering we’ll lay on each other when we act like there’s some kind of budget for compassion or
        empathy,” says Sara. “We have this attitude of, </span><span class="calibre4">I’ll save my compassion
        for the people I like, not for you.</span><span> It’s primitive brain reasoning, when we have—right here
        in our own heads—much more advanced technology available to us.”</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead1" style="margin:20.25pt 5pt 10.8pt"><span>On-Demand Practice: “Just Like Me”</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>During a difficult interaction, take a moment
        to pause. It can be the length of one breath. Or, before a difficult interaction, take a moment and
        picture this person. Then, remind yourself: “This person has experienced pain, just like me. This person
        has experienced loss, just like me. Joy, just like me. Was born from a mother, just like me; will die
        someday, just like me.” If these phrases don’t resonate with you, feel free to substitute with other
        phrases that emphasize the common humanity we share with others.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span class="calibre6">Connection</span><span> Is a Core
        Skill</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>When Sara Flitner finished her term as
        Jackson’s mayor and left office, she wasn’t done trying to shape her community for the better. She
        founded an organization, wittily named Becoming Jackson Whole, that is dedicated to training leaders
        across all arenas—community service, health, education, business, law enforcement, and more—in the kinds
        of evidence-based mindfulness skills that help build resilience and enable people to thrive personally
        and accomplish more professionally.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I met Sara in 2019, when her organization
        brought a hundred members of the community together for a research summit. I was one of the researchers
        invited to present my lab’s mindfulness findings. In my presentation, I described the research and
        training that Scott Rogers and I had been doing, offering MBAT to many different groups across our
        various projects: teachers, business professionals, military spouses, medical professionals and
        trainees. After learning how adaptable MBAT was for various groups, and that it could be started in
        person and continued with us remotely, she invited us back to Jackson to launch it. Sara and her team
        assembled community leaders to participate, specifically targeting people at various levels within their
        respective organizations—so, alongside the CEO of the hospital system, a nurse; alongside the sheriff, a
        junior officer. “Just being able to focus your attention on ‘the other,’” Sara recalls, “the progress
        was incredible. They were only there, in person with us for two days, but the kind of connections that
        mindfulness practice primed would never have been possible otherwise.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Sara credits her mindfulness practice for the
        entire existence of her organization, as well as her ability to get all these people—a lot of them busy,
        high-ranking professionals—in one room to begin with. Connection and compassion practices, she says,
        have been the bedrock of her career since the beginning. When she wanted to launch MBAT for community
        leaders, she needed to be able to call up the top CEOs in Jackson and say, </span><span class="calibre4">I need
        two days.</span><span> “And they said yes because </span><span class="calibre4">my</span><span> relationships
        with them are good,” she reports. “When I say,
        ‘Prioritize this, and you’ll have success,’ they trust me. They know their time will not be
        wasted.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>She concludes: </span><span
        class="calibre4">Connection</span><span> is not “squishy.” It’s not a soft skill. It’s absolutely
        foundational. It’s not about being nice, or “getting along” with everybody. It’s about using emotional
        literacy skills and relationship-building skills. For Sara, when it comes to navigating tough
        interactions, it’s a question of seriousness: How much do you want to contribute? Are you going to rely
        on being the loudest person in the room, or “carrying the biggest club?” Or are you going to hone the
        connection and collaboration skills you need to operate at the highest level?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“Without them, I don’t care what your other
        capacities are; you won’t be successful,” Sara says. “You could have the cure for cancer, but if nobody
        will listen to you, it’s not worth a thing.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Our final core practice in this book is a
        connection practice. In the tradition of contemplative training, it’s often called “loving-kindness
        meditation.” Yet this practice is not focused exclusively on people you love—though it can often begin
        that way. The purpose here is to cultivate your ability to connect and offer goodwill toward others—and
        yourself. We start with someone you’re close to, and then expand out. Shining your flashlight out into
        the world onto others </span><span class="calibre4">with well-wishes</span><span> is the next way we

          recede, bring to mind the image of someone with whom you have no real connection and for whom your
          feelings are neutral. It could be someone you see now and again but don’t have strong feelings for,
          one way or another. Perhaps it’s a neighbor you pass while walking your dog, a parking lot attendant
          you see daily, or a grocery store clerk. Mentally offer them the phrases.</span></li>
      <li class="num1bx" style="margin-right:17pt; margin-left:53pt"><span>As a sense of this person recedes from

          their view and are not necessarily even forgiving their actions in the past. You are simply offering
          kindness to them as a practice aimed at strengthening your ability to take another’s perspective,
          realizing that—like you—they too wish for happiness, health, safety, and ease. With this in mind,

    </div>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The instructions are straightforward, and the
        potential implications are profound.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><a name="epubbookmark181"></a><span>A growing body
        of research has been examining the effects of this practice on the brain and body, such as improved
        positive mood and feelings of well-being, as well as the improved ability to take the perspective of
        someone else, which is needed for positive social emotions. Most recently several studies have reported
        that this connection practice provides a powerful antidote to one’s implicit biases. More research needs
        to be done in this arena, but early results are very promising.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>As you probably gathered, this practice
        differs quite a bit from the suite of mindfulness practices we have been doing throughout this book
        until now. I am offering it here for a few reasons, above and beyond the well-established benefits it
        has for positive mood and stress reduction. As the name indicates, this practice increases our sense of
        connection and reduces loneliness. Why would that be? Isn’t this a solitary activity, after all?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>Can You Connect with People Who Aren’t Connecting
        Back?</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The brain, remember, is a fantastic simulation
        machine. Subregions of the default mode network that we use to remember episodes from our lives are also
        used to project ourselves into the past and future. And these same regions can also be used to project
        ourselves into the minds of other people. Doing so allows us to simulate experiencing the world from
        their perspective. Perspective-taking empowers us to understand others’ motivations, and therefore to
        extend empathy. By sending well-wishes to individuals across a full range of “closeness,” as we are
        guided to do in this practice, we offer ourselves the experience of extending both care and concern.
        Granted, this is all done in the privacy of our minds, but as we have been discussing, the mind is a
        powerful virtual-reality simulator. Extending care can increase our feelings of connection to others in
        the same way receiving it can.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I experienced this firsthand when I attended a
        loving-kindness retreat. When it came time to select a “neutral person” as the target of this practice,
        I selected an administrator in my department at the University of Miami, Dr. Richard Williams. Richard
        was neutral in that I didn’t have strong feelings for or against him. In fact, I had no real connection
        to him at all. I saw him every now and again when my grant budgets needed to be reviewed or when I had
        to make a large purchase. I’m not sure why I chose him, but I did.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>A note about doing this practice daily as
        opposed to on a retreat: The </span><a href="#epubbookmark182" style="text-decoration:none"><span
          class="calibre1">connection practice</span></a><span> you were asked to do can be completed in
        fifteen minutes, as you cycle through silently repeating the selected phrases for about three minutes
        for each of the recipients. In contrast, on a week-long silent retreat, somewhere between 100 and 150
        retreatants congregate daily for meditation in a large meditation hall from early morning to late at
        night. The practices are to be done in silence, and no ongoing guidance is given, other than the
        instructions the meditation teacher provides at the beginning of each day. Practices are divided into
        forty-five-minute sessions, with short breaks between them and longer breaks for meals. The sessions
        alternate between sitting meditation for forty-five minutes, followed by walking meditation, followed by
        sitting, and so on for the entire day. In the evening the meditation teacher presents a formal talk. On
        my retreat, instead of spending three minutes repeating the phrases for a neutral person as I would at
        home, I spent an entire day.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>On day three of my loving-kindness retreat, I
        went to work repeating the phrases and extending the well-wishes to Richard. </span><span class="calibre4">May
        you be safe, may you be happy, may you be healthy, may you live with
        ease</span><span>. It felt like not much was going on. After all, I didn’t know Richard well. I knew
        nothing about his life, his interests, his hobbies. Truth be told, the day felt really uneventful. The
        only thing I recall noticing was that my concentrative focus and commitment in wishing him well grew
        clearer and stronger over the course of the day. When I returned home from the retreat, I resumed my
        typical daily mindfulness practice, and on the rare occasion that I completed the connection practice, I
        continued to include Richard as my neutral person. But I didn’t give it too much thought.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>A month or so after my retreat, I was back in
        the psychology department building on the University of Miami’s campus, where Richard had his office. I
        was there to hear a student’s thesis defense. After the defense was over, I decided to walk over to
        Richard’s office. I merely wanted to say hello. He seemed surprised to see me and wondered if he had
        neglected to mark our meeting on his calendar. I assured him that he had not—I was just there to say hi.
        I’m sure he thought it was a bit odd. What was even odder was my internal experience on seeing him. I
        was filled with a kind of quiet joy and interest. I noticed his kind eyes, the shock of white in the
        hair that framed his face, that he looked a bit frail. The content of our interaction was quite
        ordinary. I had no sense of wanting or needing anything from the interaction. There was no lingering
        feeling, either.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Over the subsequent few years, I saw Richard
        several times for grant-related tasks. And each time, I felt that joyful connection to him. It didn’t
        really matter to me if he didn’t act any differently toward me. He was the same kind and competent
        administrator he had always been. If this sounds strange, I agree—it is unusual. But it gave me a
        glimpse into what might be happening in the minds of some exceptional people: the Dalai Lama, for
        one.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I remember meeting the Dalai Lama on stage
        when presenting our research findings at a meeting hosted by an organization that has helped catalyze
        the field of contemplative science, the Mind &amp; Life Institute. He greeted each speaker, and when it
        was my turn, I was overcome by the feeling that I mattered to him, not because of anything I had done
        but just because “I matter.” His attention felt intimate and interested, yet not personal or lingering.
        As our session was being introduced, I could see him scanning the meeting room, locking eyes, and
        offering a warm smile to individual audience members. And on their faces, I could sense the impact on
        them having received his compassionate attention for that brief moment. The experience brought to mind
        the many recent studies I had read reporting that </span><a name="epubbookmark183"></a><span>in those
        who briefly practiced loving-kindness meditation (versus a comparison group that did not), there was a
        reduction in implicit racial bias.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I have no doubt that the Dalai Lama is an
        extraordinarily special human being, for many reasons. But perhaps his unbiased offering of care and
        kindness to everyone he meets is not the result of his disposition alone. Maybe it is a result of his
        daily compassion practice. Like Congressman Tim Ryan, the Dalai Lama too trains his mind for clarity,
        compassion, and connection. Maybe we all can?</span></p>

    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Throughout this book, I have asked you to
        consider the brain and brain processes not as broken and in need of fixing, but instead as trainable and
        capable of being optimized. And now that you understand how to do so, consider asking yourself another
        important question:</span></p>
    <p class="extracts" style="margin:12pt 14pt"><span class="calibre5">WHAT WILL YOU DO WITH YOUR PEAK MIND?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Think about it. But don’t use your standard
        analytical thinking. Try applying meta-awareness to “see what is,” and try decentering to “drop the
        story,” all while holding your attention steady and receptive.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Sadly, Richard Williams died recently. And I
        felt heartsick. In my grief, I questioned the value of having developed a sense of connection with him.
        Wouldn’t I have been better off staying disconnected? Why bother getting close to anyone—aren’t they
        just another potential heartache? I know that many people feel this way.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>After some time, here’s my answer: no, I would
        not have been “better off.” Richard, even without his knowledge, gave me a great gift. He reminded me
        that life is not a zero-sum game. And extending care, concern, and kindness need not be transactional.
        It is part of what gives our lives meaning. And without it, as I said at the top of the chapter, we just
        die faster and less fulfilled.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Perhaps your motivation to learn about the
        brain science of attention and mindfulness was to uplift the lives of others you feel connected to,
        whether they be family members, co-workers, members of your community, or people you lead. How can you
        do this?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Answer: start with yourself.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“Having your own practice is the first, most
        important thing you do,” says Sara Flitner, the former mayor from Wyoming. “As mayor, I spent time
        before every public meeting in some form of reflection. When things were very conflict-laden in our
        community, it was absolutely essential for me to be the best version of myself I could be.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>When you start with yourself, you can be
        present “in the midst of chaos,” or stress, or uncertainty—and that can make an enormous difference not

    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Something we know for sure: learning about

        machine. Some are lifting weights, doing sets of reps that tone and strengthen their muscles.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Whatever form of physical activity we engage
        in, we do it because we know it works. We understand that physical exercise makes our bodies stronger,
        more flexible, more capable. It’s strange to think about because we take it for granted, but we didn’t
        always know this. Sometimes, when I walk past a SoulCycle studio and glance at all the people inside,
        struggling up an imaginary hill, I think about how that would look to a time traveler from the past, if
        you plunked them down in modern-day Miami. They’d be baffled. A hundred years ago, the idea that a
        person would get on a bicycle that was mounted in place, then ride as hard and as fast as they possibly
        could to go absolutely nowhere, would have seemed absurd.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>In the 1960s, an American doctor named Kenneth
        Cooper started researching a treatment for cardiovascular disease. Specifically, he was looking at
      </span><span class="calibre4">physical exercise.</span><span> Physical training hadn’t previously been
        considered as a potential intervention for cardiovascular health. But </span><a
        name="epubbookmark185"></a><span>Cooper uncovered a strong correlation between aerobic exercise and
        heart health. He found that certain types of exercise (the kind that gets your heart pumping)
        strengthened respiration and strengthened the heart muscle, leading to better blood oxygenation and
        other benefits. This might not seem like revolutionary information, but at the time, it was. Cooper’s
        work (which was soon adopted by the US military) found that working out the heart muscle made it
        stronger and healthier—and that specific ways of exercising were more effective than others at doing
        precisely that.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Cooper’s work on aerobics would soon spread
        out of the lab and into homes, where many pulled on leotards, tights, and leg warmers and did their best
        Jane Fonda imitation on the living room rug. But it also kicked off a sea change in the way we thought
        about exercise. Running grew more popular as it became widely understood that the way to achieve
        cardiovascular health was to </span><span class="calibre4">physically train</span><span> for it in
        specific ways. We now have decades of research into </span><span class="calibre4">why</span><span> and
      </span><span class="calibre4">how</span><span> physical exercise makes us stronger and healthier. And public
        health officials use that research to issue guidelines regarding which types of activity help us to
        become more physically fit in specific ways.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>So why aren’t we getting the same kind of
        science-backed guidance on how to keep our </span><span class="calibre4">minds</span><span> fit?</span>
    </p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Today, research on that subject is emerging at
        a meteoric pace. We are learning that certain forms of mental training are effective at training the
        brain similar to the way physical exercise works to train the body. </span><a
        name="epubbookmark186"></a><span>And when it comes to better attention—to achieve better performance,
        better emotion regulation, better communication and connection—one form of mental training consistently
        shown to work is </span><span class="calibre4">mindfulness training</span><span>. It’s no longer a
        mystery: mindfulness practices can train the brain to operate differently </span><span class="calibre4">by

        Today, contemplative neuroscience labs, like mine, are bringing people into the lab to practice
        mindfulness exercises (their mental workout session) while lying comfortably in a brain scanner. What
        are we finding? As we’ve discussed throughout this book, during mindfulness practice </span><a
        name="epubbookmark187"></a><span>the brain networks that are tied to focusing and managing attention,
        noticing and monitoring internal and external events, and mind-wandering are all activated. And when
        participants go through multiweek training programs, here’s what we see: Over time there are
        improvements in attention and working memory. Less mind-wandering. More decentering and meta-awareness.
        And a greater sense of well-being, as well as better relationships.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>And the really cool thing is, </span><a
        name="epubbookmark188"></a><span>we see changes in brain structures and brain activity that correspond
        with these improvements over time: cortical thickening in key nodes within the networks tied to
        attention (think of this as the brain’s version of better </span><span class="calibre4">muscle
        tone</span><span> for the specific muscles that a workout targets), better coordination between the
        attention network and the default mode network, </span><span class="calibre4">and</span><span> less
        default mode activity. These results give us insights into the </span><span class="calibre4">why and how
        of mindfulness training,</span><span> which we need before we can prescribe the </span><span
        class="calibre4">what</span><span>—meaning what specifically </span><span class="calibre4">you</span><span> need
        to do to achieve these benefits.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>This was exactly what drove Walt Piatt to take
        on our study on mindfulness in the military when others said no: “Every day we did at least two hours of
        physical training,” he says, “but we spent </span><span class="calibre4">zero</span><span> time on
        mental fitness.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Walt worried about sending people out on
        combat or diplomatic missions without any kind of mental training to really prepare them—to develop the
        kinds of cognitive capacities they so desperately needed to not be reactive, to see clearly, to observe
        and listen, and ultimately to make the right decisions in the heat of the moment. And then, when they
        returned home, soldiers were having trouble integrating back into civilian life. As a leader entrusted
        to ensure the well-being of his soldiers and military families, Walt saw breakdowns there every
        day.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“We’d tell them, </span><span
        class="calibre4">Don’t spend all your money, don’t take out your anger on your family,</span><span>”
        Walt said, “but we had no tools to give them.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Our research was already showing that
        mindfulness training had an impact on attention—especially when you did it </span><span class="calibre4">a
        lot.</span><span> Remember our study with the seasoned meditators, whom we tracked
        both before and after a monthlong meditation retreat in the mountains of Colorado? As we discussed
        earlier, </span><a name="epubbookmark189"></a><span>they’d shown improvements in sustained attention and
        alerting. They also had better working memory encoding, reduced mind-wandering, and greater
        meta-awareness after their retreat. So, indeed, twelve hours a day of being mindful, with many of those
        hours spent practicing formal mindfulness exercises, had many measurable benefits. Yet a big question
        lingered, namely: How much mindfulness practice did you actually need to do? We certainly couldn’t go
        around telling people to meditate for twelve hours a day.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><a name="epubbookmark190"></a><span>That study with
        the Marines in West Palm Beach had shown a </span><span class="calibre4">dose-response
        effect</span><span> with mindfulness practice for attention, working memory, and mood: the more that
        people practiced, the more they benefited. And how much did they practice to see benefits? While we
        asked them to practice for thirty minutes every day, we found a wide range across participants. On
        average, those who saw benefits practiced </span><span class="calibre4">twelve minutes a day over eight
        weeks.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>All of this—the Colorado study and the West
        Palm Beach study—was encouraging: promising evidence that the link between mindfulness practice and
        strengthened attentional capacity was real. What we needed to figure out next was what solution would
        have a practical application for people in the real world, in their everyday lives.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>A “STRONG” Test</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>When my team and I flew out to the US Army’s
        Schofield Barracks site in Hawaii to begin a study, we had a couple hiccups. The base was smack in the
        middle of the island of Oahu, and had no state-of-the-art brainwave lab like the one we used back on
        campus. What we ideally needed for a brainwave study was a Faraday cage: a room surrounded by a
        conductive metallic mesh that blocks out the electromagnetic fields around it. But getting a massive
        quantity of metal, weighing close to two thousand pounds, to encase an entire room on a military base in
        Hawaii wasn’t really a possibility. So we did the best we could and built the brainwave recording lab in
        a broom closet, precariously positioning our equipment to avoid electromagnetic interference.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We cleared everything out—brooms and dustpans
        and boxes, cleaning supplies, industrial-size packages of toilet paper, metal shelving—and drove all
        over Oahu searching for materials to insulate the walls for light-and-sound dampening so that we could
        create a better controlled environment for our experiments. We found a Walmart and bought out all their
        bolts of black felt. Back on the base, we stapled layer upon layer of felt to the closet walls. We
        dragged in boxes of computer equipment, cables, and amplifiers that we had mailed in advance. In the
        room next door, we set up computer stations for the soldiers to use during testing, partitioning them as
        best we could with poster board from the local office supply store. It wasn’t perfect, but it would have
        to do.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We called this the STRONG (Schofield Barracks
        Training and Research on Neurobehavioral Growth) project, and it was a first-of-its-kind, large-scale
        study of mindfulness training among active-duty US Army soldiers who were back from deployment and now
        preparing to deploy again—in this case, to Afghanistan. Our early studies on mindfulness training had
        shown a measurable impact, but while encouraging, those studies were small. The STRONG project, by
        contrast, would last four years and would test mindfulness across a much larger group of service
        members. Since then, we have gone on to do </span><a name="epubbookmark191"></a><span>many more
        large-scale studies with military service members, military spouses, first responders, community
        leaders, and many other groups. Before we could offer a prescription for time-pressured, high-stress
        groups—which at some level means all of us—we would need to answer key questions about content and
        dosage:</span></p>

    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We wanted to compare mindfulness training to
        another type of program the US Army had already begun implementing. This form of training offered
        exercises prompting participants to generate positive emotion by remembering positive experiences or
        reframing current challenges through a positive lens.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>What we found: the positivity training was not
        only less effective </span><a name="epubbookmark192"></a><span>than the mindfulness training, it
        appeared to be </span><span class="calibre4">actively depleting attention and working memory in these
        predeployment soldiers.</span><span> Since positivity </span><span class="calibre4">requires</span><span>
        reappraisal and reframing, it also requires attention. You use
        your attention and working memory to basically build a castle in the sky. It’s fragile and requires a
        lot of work to keep it from falling apart—especially under demanding and stressful circumstances like
        these soldiers were facing. Positivity training seemed to be putting more strain on their already
        strained attention.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Other studies confirmed the same: mindfulness
        training strengthened attention better than other time-matched programs. Remember the college football
        players to whom we offered training in the weight room during their preseason training? We chose that
        setting on purpose, to align the trainings they were receiving with the idea of “exercise.” One group
        received mindfulness training, the other relaxation exercises. Relaxation did have upsides for
        participants, but these upsides weren’t unique to this training. Players who adhered most to either
        program, be it mindfulness or relaxation, reported better emotional well-being than those who adhered
        least, but </span><span class="calibre4">only</span><span> those who received mindfulness training
        benefited in their attention.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Finding that mindfulness training was better
        than other forms of training (such as positivity and relaxation) signaled a big advance. It made it
        clear that it was mindfulness exercises—not merely any active form of training—that were doing the work
        of improving attention and working memory.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>Content: Just Do It!</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Now to the next question: What should the
        training contain? Did it help participants to have what we call “didactic content,” or learning
      </span><span class="calibre4">about</span><span> mindfulness and why it benefits you?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Mindfulness training in a research setting has
        two requirements for participants:</span></p>
    <ol type="1" style="margin:0pt; padding-left:0pt">
      <li class="bul" style="margin-top:12pt; margin-right:5pt; margin-left:41pt"><span>Attend the weekly course
          meetings, where a skilled trainer introduces them to practices and related content, and</span></li>
      <li class="bul" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:41pt; margin-bottom:18pt"><span>Engage in the daily
          out-of-class mindfulness practice (“homework” exercises) that they are assigned to do.</span></li>
    </ol>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The first study from the STRONG project
        (comparing mindfulness to positivity) assigned participants thirty minutes of practice, daily for eight
        weeks. But we’d cut the number of hours </span><span class="calibre4">with</span><span> the trainer from
        twenty-four hours down to sixteen. We were excited to discover that the mindfulness training was still
        beneficial, even with this reduction in hours with the trainer. This was great news for our
        time-pressured participants. Could we reduce it even further? Could we cut it in half?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>To whittle it down that much, we needed to
        figure out what pieces of the training we absolutely had to keep, and what could be thrown out. Other
        studies across a variety of high-stress groups had shown us that </span><span class="calibre4">practice
        itself</span><span> really matters for seeing benefits. So it was this feature of the program that we
        keyed in on.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><a name="epubbookmark193"></a><span>In the next
        study, we ran two simultaneous courses: both eight weeks long, both with thirty minutes of identical
        “homework” per day, both taught by the same trainer. The difference was that in one, the trainer spent
        seven out of the eight hours of class time on “didactic” mindfulness-related content—they discussed
        mindfulness, stress, resilience, and neuroplasticity. It was like going to the gym for a group weight
        training course and having the trainer tell you how great weight training is, all its benefits, and how
        to use the equipment and monitor your form, but not allowing very much time to actually exercise during
        class time. In the other course, the trainer spent far more time on mindfulness exercises—doing them and
        discussing them, without all the background information.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>It seems fairly intuitive: if you don’t do the
        workout, it’s probably a waste of time. And that’s exactly what we found. The practice-focused group
        outperformed the other group, which looked no different than getting no training at all. This discovery
        was a big win for us: we could cut the course duration </span><span class="calibre4">in
        half</span><span>, from sixteen hours down to eight, as long as we focused a lot of the class time on
        actual practice.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>There was one more roadblock, though. We were
        seeing a troubling pattern across all our studies in the STRONG project, which was that participants
        weren’t doing anywhere near as much practice as we were assigning. Their actual practice time was well
        below the thirty minutes. They most definitely were </span><span class="calibre4">not</span><span> doing
        their homework. What gives?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Our best guess? Practicing thirty minutes a
        day was just too much. It seemed like an impossible lift. It sounded too hard and too long. We wanted
        them to feel the burn, but they were fearful of pulling a muscle. They couldn’t fit it in to their
        packed schedules, and so chose not to regularly practice. Sure, thirty minutes of mindfulness practice
        per day was going to help people if they did it, but none of this was going to help anybody if it wasn’t
        realistic.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>And I had another problem to contend with: the
        US Army, excited about our efforts, asked me how quickly I could scale up to offer it to many, many,
        more soldiers. They wanted me to get trainers out to multiple military bases—</span><span
        class="calibre4">fast.</span><span> How many trainers did I have available? My answer: </span><span
        class="calibre4">one.</span><span> Our one and only trainer on all of these studies was my colleague who
        had developed the program, informed by her own experience as a veteran and mindfulness
        practitioner.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I needed to take a different approach. The
        program had to be time-efficient and scalable. It had to be the lightest, most compact, most impactful
        version we could offer. What was the </span><span class="calibre4">minimum required dose</span><span>
        for these time-pressured people, who desperately needed this training, to see results?</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>Getting to the Minimum Effective Dose</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>If mindfulness training is beneficial, but
        nobody actually </span><span class="calibre4">does</span><span> it, who is it helping? </span><span
        class="calibre4">Nobody.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We set out to drill down to a real
        “prescription” we could offer people. Now, there were a couple ways we could do this. The most obvious
        would be something like this: recruit a thousand participants, divide them up into groups, assign them
        different amounts of time (as in, Group A does thirty minutes, Group B does twenty-five, Group C does
        twenty, and so on), and then test them all and compare. Makes sense, right? A lot of scientific studies
        are run this way—for example, studies on the efficacy of drugs, when researchers want to determine a
        “minimum effective dose.” The problem is that with mindfulness, it just doesn’t work. It’s not like
        giving a drug dosage that people can take. Participants simply don’t do what you tell them to do. You
        can give them an assignment like “Do thirty minutes a day,” but there is no guarantee that they’ll do
        it. In fact, as we quickly learned, they probably won’t.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I partnered up with Scott Rogers; he’d already
        written books on mindfulness for parents and lawyers, and his style was flexible, practical, and
        accessible. This was the kind of help we needed. Looking back at the data we’d already gathered
        comparing two groups—a mindfulness-training group and a group that didn’t get the training—the results
        were not great! There was no real difference between groups afterward in the attention tests we gave
        them. Why? Was it because mindfulness doesn’t work? Or was it because people were all over the place in
        their homework practice? Some did the thirty. Others did zero.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Thankfully, there was some buried treasure,
        data we could use that hinted at an answer and told us what might really work for people. We’d broken
        the training group into two smaller groups instead of lumping them all together: a high-practice group
        and a low-practice group. Here we hit on something. The high-practice group </span><span
        class="calibre4">did</span><span> benefit. So we zoomed in on them. The average number of minutes per
        day that this group practiced? </span><span class="calibre4">Twelve.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We had a number. We took it and designed a new
        study. We asked our participants (football players this time) to do </span><span
        class="calibre4">only</span><span> twelve minutes of practice. And to help them hit the nail on the
        head, Scott recorded twelve-minute-long guided exercises for them to use. They didn’t have to set their
        own timers or even push </span><span class="calibre4">stop</span><span>—they just had to follow along.
        We made it as user-friendly as possible.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We ran the monthlong study asking them to do
        their guided twelve-minute exercises </span><span class="calibre4">every day.</span><span> Once again,
        we broke the sample into two groups: high practice and low practice. And once again, the high-practice
        group showed positive results: </span><span class="calibre4">attentional benefits.</span><span> And on
        average, these guys did their twelve-minute exercises five days per week.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The pieces were falling into place. We were
        homing in on a recipe that time-pressured people were actually willing to do. And, when they followed
        it, their attention benefited. It was, to the best of our knowledge up to that point, moving us to a
        practical prescription, the </span><span class="calibre4">minimum required dosage</span><span> for
        training your attention: </span><span class="calibre4">Four weeks. Five days a week. Twelve minutes a
        day.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Finally, we were able to design a program we
        could easily teach to other trainers so that they could deliver it more widely to demographics that
        needed it. And we could teach them fast. We wanted to stay with high-pressure, high-performing groups,
        like athletes, so we conducted a study in elite warriors, special operations forces (SOF). We were
        fortunate to partner with a colleague, an operational psychologist who worked with SOF, who was
        certified in offering mindfulness-based stress reduction. He flew to Miami and we trained him to deliver
        our program. We called the program Mindfulness-Based Attention Training (MBAT). As we had done before,
        my research team and I packed our laptops and headed to yet another military base, to see if this
        training actually worked outside of our campus environment and out in the field. We tried two variants
        of MBAT: one that would be delivered over four weeks, as we designed, and another over two weeks. The
        results were exciting and promising: MBAT benefited attention and working memory in these elite
        warriors. The benefits were </span><span class="calibre4">only</span><span> there when the program was
        delivered over four weeks. Two weeks was too short.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We were on our way. Since then, we’ve trained
        a lot of trainers: army performance coaches who then went on to train soldiers; military spouses who
        trained other military spouses; medical school faculty who trained med students; human resource
        professionals who trained employees. Most of these trainers had no prior mindfulness experience, but in
        just ten weeks, we were able to get them up to speed on delivering MBAT. The key to success was that
        even though they didn’t know much about mindfulness before delivering the program, they were intimately
        familiar with the context and challenges of the groups they set out to train.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>So what does this all mean for you?
        Mindfulness training does indeed have a dose-response effect, which means the more you practice, the
        more you benefit. But as we now know, “do as much as you can” doesn’t work for most of us. Based on
        these many studies, what we’ve come to understand is that asking people to do too much, especially those
        with a lot of demands and very little time, de-motivates them. The key is having a goal that is not just
        inspiring, but </span><span class="calibre4">possible.</span><span> Twelve minutes worked better than
        thirty, and five days worked better than every single day. So </span><a name="epubbookmark194"></a><span>this is
        what I want to encourage you to do: practice twelve minutes a
        day, five days a week. If you do this much, you are on track to really benefit. And the even better news
        is that if you do more, the benefits go up.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>An important caveat: if you are busy and
        stressed but are also suffering from an ailment, disorder, or illness, this prescription may not work
        for you. This is not a therapy or treatment. We aren’t trying to reduce symptoms or even stress. We’re
        targeting our training to </span><span class="calibre4">improve attention</span><span>—that’s the goal.
      </span><a name="epubbookmark195"></a><span>There are other programs out there incorporating mindfulness as
        part of a treatment plan for psychological disorders like depression, anxiety, and PTSD, and these
        programs do show a lot of promise. They also require more time (forty-five minutes of daily practice, in
        some cases) and other interventions alongside contemplative practice. Mindfulness training at the
        prescription I’m offering here will help your attention. But if you are turning to mindfulness as a
        solution for other challenges, you may need support from a clinician or medical professional.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Now that you know what to do, how can you make
        sure you do it? I’d recommend putting it on your calendar or setting a phone reminder to ping you.
      </span><span class="calibre4">Twelve minutes.</span><span> It isn’t a lot. But it’s the minimum required
        dose. And if you come away from this book with anything, I want it to be a clear sense of how important
        this is. We’re busy. We’re time-pressured. We are always under the gun. But twelve more minutes of work
        is simply not going to catch you up as much as sitting quietly, and on purpose, with your breath. For
        only a little effort and a small investment of time, you can reap an enormous reward.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I get asked by many high-achieving,
        high-stakes professionals whether this practice can be condensed even more. Inevitably, someone will
        ask: “Four weeks is too long—can’t we just do something in an afternoon?” Or “Twelve minutes is too hard
        to find in my day, so can I do less?”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>My answer? Sure you can. And it might benefit
        you temporarily, like going for a walk can benefit you. But if you want to train for better heart
        health, you’d want to do more than go for the occasional leisurely walk. In the same way, if you want to
        protect and strengthen your attention, more is required. We have a growing body of research now. The
        science is clear. For this to work, </span><span class="calibre4">you have to work it.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>Working
        It</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.
        and Working It In</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Paul Singerman is a bankruptcy attorney and
        co-chair at one of the most prominent business-law firms in Florida. He’s one of the busiest people I
        know, and he operates in a world that is extremely high-stress: he spends most of his days working with
        and representing individuals and businesses going through Chapter 11 bankruptcy. He wakes up before
        dawn; spends full workdays in meetings, on calls, and in court; then caps them off with paperwork,
        research, and writing in the evening. Through the stay-at-home, quarantined months of the COVID-19
        crisis (which is when he and I had the chance to catch up), he was still going to court—but via Zoom. It
        was one of the busiest times in his entire thirty-seven-year career—and the hardest.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“We are blessed to be busy,” he said, “but it
        is the saddest ‘busy’ I have ever been. There’s an immense destruction of enterprise value. People
        losing everything, due to no fault of their own. It’s an intense time, it’s a sad time, it’s an
        exhausting time.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I inquired: Was he still able to find the time
        to practice mindfulness, through this crisis and all the extra demands?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“Absolutely,” he said. “It’s the first thing I
        do every morning. Taking the time to do the practice pays me back in all kinds of ways, all day long.
        You know what they say: if you don’t have time to meditate for five minutes, then meditate for
        ten.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Paul wasn’t always into mindfulness. He came
        upon it in an article in the </span><span class="calibre4">New York Times</span><span> Sunday Business
        section.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“It caught my eye because it was in the
      </span><span class="calibre4">business</span><span> section,” he says. “If it had been in Sunday Styles, I
        probably would have flipped right past it. I thought mindfulness was bullshit.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>This article was about an engineer, Chade-Meng
        Tan, one of the earliest engineers at Google and the 107th employee at the company, who had taken up
        mindfulness practice and found that it felt useful and evidence-based. Paul’s interest was piqued. He
        gave it a shot. And he quickly found that the practice—far from being the “soft, fluffy” sort of
        activity he’d initially taken it for—helped him to be more effective in the courtroom, and in other
        areas of his law practice as well. Like a lot of lawyers in his field, he used to believe that his
        professional edge came from being aggressive. </span><span class="calibre4">Mindfulness</span><span>
        sounded like the sort of thing that would soften that edge. In fact, he found that it only enhanced his
        capacities. Made him sharper. </span><span class="calibre4">More</span><span> effective. And it’s
        because of the core strengths that mindfulness develops: the ability to stay present; to stay
        nonreactive; to stay aware of your own mind, of others, of the immediate environment.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“I’m striving to be a more efficient,
        effective, and better data-gatherer in three buckets, all the time, every waking minute,” he says.
        “Those three buckets are: myself, the other person, and the environment I’m
        in</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.
        and frequently, that’s the courtroom.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>For Paul, it starts with himself—with the
        awareness of what’s going on in his own mind. And that includes not only the awareness of off-task
        thoughts, but also awareness of his own emotions and sensations through the high-stress, adversarial
        situations he regularly finds himself in. Frustration, anxiety, fatigue, anger, hunger—they can get the
        better of any lawyer in a courtroom situation that is both lengthy and contentious. But because of
        Paul’s mindfulness practice, he now has the tools to bring himself quickly back to the present. In his
        line of work, attentional lapses really add up. He often says to his team of lawyers after meetings,
        courtroom encounters, and other interactions: “That would have gone so much differently ten years ago.”
        It happens multiple times per week—the cognitive capacities built by mindfulness practice show up in
        impactful and practical ways and change the way things go.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“It basically gives you the ability to control
        the future—to meaningfully influence it,” Paul says. “You avoid a reactive behavior, you avoid the mess
        that follows
        it.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>. I
        used to do and say things in the moment that I’d regret later, because the fallout would suck up my
        time—and my energy. I think of it this way: I’m now controlling the future, because I’m giving myself
        the ability to do more worthwhile stuff with my time.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Paul saw such an impact on himself, his work,
        and his capacities, that he wanted to bring others in. I met him when he invited me to the first
        mindfulness workshop he hosted for his entire firm. Now, my colleague Scott Rogers and I continue to
        provide trainings for his firm—they’ve seen the benefits, and they make it a priority.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>For Paul and the other time-pressured,
        extraordinarily busy people we’ve met in this book—from Lieutenant General Walt Piatt, whose day is
        scheduled right down to the last minute, to Sara Flitner, who ran both a town and her own consulting
        business at the same time—their mindfulness practice is the </span><span class="calibre4">last</span><span>
        thing they would give up in a packed day where “something’s gotta
        give.” More than </span><span class="calibre4">taking up</span><span> time, these high-functioning,
        high-achieving people have found that mindfulness practice </span><span class="calibre4">creates</span><span>
        time. Paul puts it this way: “My study and practice of mindfulness
        has yielded the single greatest return on an investment I’ve ever seen.”</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>You Can Start Now and Benefit</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>During the COVID-19 crisis, I heard from a lot
        of people who wanted to know if mindfulness training could help them cope. The pandemic was a long
        period of challenge. This is exactly what we mean by “period of high demand.” It has all the qualifiers.
        We use an acronym to describe the most potent, high-demand, high-kryptonite circumstances that degrade
        attention: </span><span class="calibre4">VUCA.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Volatility. Uncertainty. Complexity.
        Ambiguity.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The COVID-19 pandemic, as it unfolded
        throughout 2020, was an extreme example of VUCA. It was constantly changing. Information was sparse,
        then contradictory and incessantly updated. No easy answers or solutions were offered. It was the kind
        of circumstance that’s excellent at engaging and draining attention. People would tell me it was the
        only thing they could think about—that their thoughts were racing. I heard from many people who just had
        this </span><span class="calibre4">fog.</span><span> As if their brains had gone sluggish, unable to
        focus on the simplest of tasks. I know that feeling. I felt it! I felt it as I re-created my lab
        virtually, moved my courses online, supported my family and friends as they adjusted to a new world—all
        with an impending sense of unease that “it’s all too much. I just want to go to sleep and wake up when
        this thing is over.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>People urgently wanted to know: Could
        mindfulness practice help them, right now?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>My answer was: “Yes, absolutely. </span><span
        class="calibre4">Start now.</span><span>”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>What I told people was this: You can pick up
        these practices any time. They are free. They are simple. They require no special equipment, no
        particular location. They are always available to you. You can use them to start protecting your
        attention and working memory </span><span class="calibre4">today.</span><span> If you’re already
        “deployed”—in other words, in the throes of a high-demand period—you will still be able to </span><span
        class="calibre4">protect</span><span> your attention during this time.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The lesson is: Start wherever you are. Start
        if you’re going through a time of high stress and high demand. Start even if you’re </span><span
        class="calibre4">not</span><span> going through a time of high stress and high demand. Don’t wait until
        pressures rise. Begin building your capacities now.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We are all always in “predeployment,” so to
        speak, and we never know when the next big challenge will come along and ask us to rise to it. So start
        now.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>How Do I Do It?</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>In this book, you’ve tried out two types of
        practices: the Core Practices or “formal” practices, in which you sit or stand and do the mental workout
        for three minutes or more, and the “On-Demand” and Optional Practices. Both are important. The first is
        foundational, and the second can help anchor your day in mindful moments that give you attentional
        boosts.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>At the back of this book, you’ll find a
        suggested weekly schedule for how to structure your first four weeks of practice. This is infinitely
        customizable, though. Exercising attention in the ways I’ve outlined can set you up for success.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We’re at an exciting moment: we have an
        amassing evidence base of research. We are learning more and more about what works, and this is going to
        continue to get better over the coming years and decades. Right now, this is our best understanding of
        what can help you in terms of your attention and working memory.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>When Should I Do It?</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>There’s no particular time that I’d prescribe
        for you to do your formal daily practice. A lot of people choose to do it in the morning, to begin the
        day with a mental workout the same way they would start the day with a physical workout. Paul Singerman
        does his practice as soon as he wakes, often before the sun is up. Sara Flitner also prefers to do hers
        first thing in the morning—both put a premium on the time of the day before they look at their phones,
        read the news, see the messages that have rolled into their in-boxes overnight. The time </span><span
        class="calibre4">before</span><span> they have to engage with the demands of the day is the right time,
        for them, to mentally prepare.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Walt Piatt, by contrast, squeezes his in where
        he can. It’s tough in the military, even as mindfulness is gradually becoming more accepted as a
        valuable “mental workout.” It’s still hard for him to get even five minutes to “do nothing.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“People at the Pentagon think you’re crazy,”
        Walt says. “</span><span class="calibre4">Five minutes to do nothing?</span><span> They think,
      </span><span class="calibre4">I could do ten things in those five minutes!</span><span> My attitude is,
      </span><span class="calibre4">Yes, but if you take five minutes to do ‘nothing,’ you can do a hundred more
        things after.</span><span>”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>On his last deployment to Iraq, Walt would tie
        the practice to his fitness routine. After his regular morning workout, he’d end it at this particular
        grove of palm trees that had turned brown in the dry desert air. He would sit and gaze at them, fix his
        focus there, and do his breath awareness practice every day that he could manage it.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>In Iraq, he had less time to practice, and it
        was even more critical that he do so. He wedged in micro-moments of practice wherever he could. During
        helicopter flights—which would always end in a new location and a new situation, whether diplomatic or
        otherwise—he’d take the time to do a practice. He’d turn off his headset for a few moments, silencing
        the chatter of the pilots. As the copter jolted and bounced along at 150 mph, he would lower his gaze
        and do a “drop the story” practice. He would remind himself:</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span class="calibre4">This will probably not be as
        I expect.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span class="calibre4">There is so much more I don’t
        know.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span class="calibre4">And what I</span><span> do
      </span><span class="calibre4">know is probably incomplete.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“What these practices do for me is help me
        self-regulate,” Walt reports. “You can feel when you don’t have the capacity to make a good decision.
        When you don’t have the mental energy.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>In Iraq, when he started to feel that way, he
        would go outside and water a tiny patch of grass at night—10 p.m., 11 p.m., midnight. He would have been
        going since early in the morning and would still have hours of work left to do. But he knew he needed
        the attentional refresh.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“It was the mental exhaustion that would start
        to get to me,” he says. “The distractions would start going up. I could feel myself not focusing, not
        listening.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>When he first arrived on base and planted the
        patch of grass, nobody thought it would grow. But it did. So, late at night, when he was losing the
        attentional capacities he relied on, he’d go out and water it. He’d take the hose and put his thumb over
        the top and shower the bit of grass as gently as he could. One of the soldiers in his unit, trying to be
        helpful, offered to get him a sprinkler: “Sir, if you need the grass watered, we can take care of it!”
        He said no. The point wasn’t getting the grass watered. The point was that </span><span
        class="calibre4">he</span><span> watered the grass. He used the watering time as practice time. Almost
        like a body scan, he filled up his mental whiteboard with the sensory experience of the activity. The
        cold water going smoothly past his thumb. The smell of the grass. The smell of the desert.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>And then he’d end up having conversations with
        the people who passed by, who were perhaps startled to see the general out late at night with a hose,
        watering a tiny patch of struggling grass. People who worked for him would pass by, and they’d chat
        briefly—he’d hear things about the nitty-gritty of their days that he wouldn’t have otherwise known. One
        of the Iraqi generals would sometimes be out strolling at the same time, and they’d end up talking. They
        chatted about farming. About the little town the Iraqi general came from. About how many date trees he
        grew on his farm at home, far away.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The practice will benefit you, too, if you
        make the time for it—both the formal practice and the informal practices that you can fill in throughout
        the day. Try this: When you wake up in the morning, don’t roll over and grab your phone, or hop right
        up. Lie on your back. Take ten or even just five deep breaths. Focus on the breath. And maybe notice the
        thoughts that arise. It’ll give you insight—information about yourself, your mind, your attention—that
        you can use today.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Try mindful teeth brushing. As you brush each
        tooth, direct your flashlight to those sensations. On the bus or subway, don’t pull out your phone. Sit
        as you would in formal practice, embodying an alert, comfortable posture; close your eyes or lower your
        gaze, whatever works best, and take five minutes—or the length of the ride. Or perhaps offer the
        loving-kindness phrases to the people on the train with you. Sharon Salzberg, my friend and trusted
        meditation teacher to many, made a New Year’s resolution one year of “no overlooked people.” When
        standing in line, waiting for anything, or walking down the busy sidewalks of New York City, she would
        make a point to notice the people around her and simply offer each one a silent, simple wish for
        happiness: “May you be happy! May you be happy! May you be happy!” She mentally doled out well-wishes of
        happiness in all directions, the way Oprah used to give new cars to everyone in her TV audience.
        Noticing those around us and directing our attention outward in this way boomerangs back toward us,
        benefiting our interactions with others and our sense of happiness and well-being.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“You can do it sitting in a chair, sitting on

        Mind</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Amy is a freelance writer; her husband is a
        high school teacher. She visited our lab when she was researching an article on mindfulness and
        attention, and she posed an interesting question.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>She’d noticed that she and her husband seemed
        to have wildly different attentional strengths and weaknesses. Her husband seemed to have </span><span
        class="calibre4">terrible</span><span> working memory—stuff dropped off his whiteboard right and left.
        At the same time, he often seemed highly skilled at staying in the moment, even when there were major
        pressures that might have easily pulled him into mental time travel and rumination. She’d watched him
        many times glance at a combative email from a
        parent</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.
        and then just close the mail app and happily move on with his day. He seemed unaffected—he was able to
        shield his attention from the “loop of doom.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“If I open an email like that,” Amy said,
        “that’s </span><span class="calibre4">it.</span><span> I’m done for. I’m sucked into thinking about it
        until I deal with it or solve the problem—even when I know for a fact that now is not the time, and it’s
        not solvable. I just can’t stop myself.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>And yet, there were other attentional
        challenges when she saw herself excel—like holding a lot in working memory.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>She wanted to know: Why was her husband so
        naturally terrible at one aspect of attention, and great at another? Where do these natural abilities
        and vulnerabilities come from?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>My answer might not have been very satisfying:
        We don’t really know where they come from. Your attentional profile is shaped by all kinds of forces,
        from the chemistry of your brain, to your upbringing and life experience, to the way you use your
        attention now. I call it “the mixing board of the mind.” Just like the mixing board in a recording
        studio, we all have different levels, different settings. Each attentional profile is wildly unique. But
        whatever your “settings,” you can benefit from mindfulness training.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>Embrace the Suck</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Anybody who’s ever taken up a new physical
        exercise regimen knows how it feels at first: </span><span class="calibre4">worse.</span><span> If you
        take up running, the first few weeks are going to be rough. You’ll be acutely aware of your body
        struggling to do what you tell it to do. The same can be true with a new mental exercise regimen, and
        with your brain.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>One of the challenges we have is that after a
        week or two of participating in a mindfulness training course, some people say, “I feel worse, I feel
      </span><span class="calibre4">more</span><span> stressed.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>My answer to that? </span><span
        class="calibre4">It’s a good sign.</span><span> It means it’s working. You temporarily feel worse
        because you’re becoming more meta-aware. Whereas before, you might have been mostly unconscious of your
        own mind-wandering, now you’re noticing that you’re doing it all the time. You’re noticing when you
        can’t get your mind out of the loop of doom, or when your thoughts stray back to the same sore subject
        over and over again, and you can’t stop it. It’s not that these things are happening more—it’s that
        you’ve </span><span class="calibre4">become more aware of them.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>It’s hard, because the first thing that
        happens with mindfulness practice is that you become acutely aware of the ways your mind can rebel
        against what you actually want it to do. You see how it’s restless and squirrelly. It doesn’t want to do
        the twelve minutes of breath awareness. It wants to do something </span><span class="calibre4">else.
        Anything else!</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span class="calibre4">“But it’s
        boring!”</span><span> is the protest I hear most frequently from those who are just beginning
        mindfulness training. My response? Yes, it is! </span><span class="calibre4">And that’s the
        point.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>It’s hard. You get bored—</span><span
        class="calibre4">quickly.</span><span> We know how quickly the restless mind wants to move on to
        something else—how rapidly it reverts to its self-focused “default mode.” Your mind wants to wander;
        your work is to notice that, and then (for some practices) to guide the mind back—over and over.
      </span><span class="calibre4">That’s the workout.</span><span> When you’re doing your basic breath awareness
        practice, each time your mind drifts, you notice the drift, you gently pull your awareness back to your
        breath sensations.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>. </span><span
        class="calibre4">that’s a push-up.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Try reframing it this way: mindfulness can be
        helpful </span><span class="calibre4">because</span><span> it gets boring. </span><span
        class="calibre4">Boredom</span><span> is ultimately what’s at the root of our 24/7 engagement—it’s what
        drives us onto phones and news feeds in the middle of other tasks, or in any moment of downtime, denying
        us creative spontaneous thought and memory-consolidation time. And what we know from our lab studies is
        that </span><span class="calibre4">anything</span><span> can get boring if you do it long enough—even
        the most thrilling or high-stakes activity. The vigilance decrement—the waning of task performance over
        time—shows us that this is true even in situations where keeping your focus is a matter of life and
        death. Boredom drives us to pick up our phones and scroll, or even to scan our own minds for content.
        Boredom fuels our incessant search for other types of cognitive engagement. And what we know about
        continual engagement is that it saps resources.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>When you feel bored, like you just want to be
        doing something else, that’s when you need to get curious. With physical exercise, we call it feeling
        the burn. </span><span class="calibre4">That moment,</span><span> the moment of “Do I really need to do
        twelve minutes?” or “How much longer until the timer goes off?” or “Can’t I do a different
        practice?”—that’s your “mental burn.” It’s the equivalent of a muscle burn as you do a squat, though it
        feels like restlessness. Boredom. Discomfort. Walt Piatt says that his service members like to say,
        “Embrace the suck.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>You have to deal with that mental chatter,
        resistance, and boredom, because </span><span class="calibre4">this is where you want to build
        tolerance.</span><span> The next time you’re in a situation in real life, outside your formal practice,
        when you’re dealing with that kind of mental resistance to focus and stay present, you may be able to
        handle it that much better.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>This Is Not About “Feeling Better”</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I was invited on a radio show to talk about my
        research on mindfulness and attention in high-stress groups. The show began with another invited guest,
        a self-described meditation teacher, leading a practice right on the air. The teacher began by asking us
        to close our
        eyes</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.
        and “imagine fields full of flowers, blue skies.” This person proceeded to lead us through a mental
        activity focused on pleasant visualizations and relaxation.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>My red flags were going up all over the place.
        He described this as a </span><span class="calibre4">mindfulness</span><span> exercise, but there was
        nothing emphasizing those key aspects of present-centered, nonjudgmental, and nonreactive qualities of
        attention. And as we’ve discussed throughout this book, this sort of approach does not work well under
        high stress; positivity and relaxation don’t work under high stress. You’re spending your cognitive fuel
        trying to build that lovely, imaginary world instead of building your core capacities: </span><span
        class="calibre4">The ability to notice where your attention is, to bring your mind back when it wanders.
        The ability to fill your whiteboard with the present-moment experience. The ability to resist
        story-making and to simply observe. The ability to become aware of when your mind needs to be
        redirected.</span><span> These are the skills that will serve you, especially during challenging
        circumstances.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>After the other guest’s “mindfulness” exercise
        was over, the radio host turned to me next, welcomed me warmly to the show, and began the interview.
        “That was lovely,” she said. “Now, Dr. Jha. Why does mindfulness make us feel better?”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“Well,” I said. “It doesn’t.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Into the startled silence, I explained:
        Mindfulness practice is </span><span class="calibre4">not</span><span> about making you “feel better.”
        It is not about achieving a special state of relaxation or about being blissful or joyful. Remember: the
        basic description of mindfulness practice is </span><span class="calibre4">paying attention to
        present-moment experience without telling a story about it.</span><span> And that’s the promise: that
        you will become, if you engage in these exercises, more able to be your best, most skillful, most
        capable self through the present moment—even if that present moment is hard.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>There is nothing wrong with wanting to feel
        better! But as we’ve seen in this book, those common tactics we so often use to try to feel
        better—avoiding upsetting thoughts, suppression, escapism—actually sabotage us, drain our attention
        more, and usually leave us feeling worse</span><span class="calibre4">.</span><span> We might not be
        able to “feel better” about the present moment. But the truth is, the present moment is the only one we
        are ever alive in. What we want to build is a kind of mental agility—not to push away difficulty or
        shield our self from it, but to </span><span class="calibre4">be with</span><span> the situation that
        arises. And with that you become better able to maneuver through difficulty.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Here’s the bottom line: if you engage in
        mindfulness training, you </span><span class="calibre4">will</span><span> feel better, but not simply
        from the practices alone. The practices will build your attentional capacity and </span><span
        class="calibre4">that</span><span> will help you fully experience moments of joy, thrive in demanding
        circumstances, and successfully navigate moments of crisis with a reservoir of resilience.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I’m surrounded by people who changed their
        lives because of their mindfulness practice. From students who’ve worked in my lab, to my own family
        members, to some of the extraordinary people you’ve met throughout this book, including an Army general
        who meditated under thirsty brown palm trees while deployed to Iraq. I know mindfulness practice changed
        my life—it allowed me to continue doing all the things I wanted to do at a time when I felt like I was
        running out of options. To be a scientist and a mother, to run a lab and be present for my spouse every
        day, to have the life and career I
        envisioned</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.
        I needed mindfulness practice. Not to feel better, but to </span><span class="calibre4">experience my
        life better</span><span class="calibre4">&#xa0;</span><span class="calibre4">.</span><span
        class="calibre4">&#xa0;</span><span class="calibre4">.</span><span class="calibre4">&#xa0;</span><span
        class="calibre4">.</span><span> and then, almost as an afterthought, I started to feel
        better</span><span class="calibre4">.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>We Can Do Hard Things</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>When I went to India recently to present my
        research at a conference that the Dalai Lama was convening at his monastery on the topic of mindfulness
        and education, I
        was</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.</span><span>&#xa0;</span><span>.
        well, unsettled. Buckling my seatbelt for the eighteen-hour flight, I felt preoccupied. At this late
        hour, I was still debating what I wanted to emphasize from all the slides I had prepared. Was my topic
        central to the theme of the conference? Most of the other presentations would be about research in
        children, but I’d done only a few studies with kids, and they were not part of my latest research. All
        of a sudden, I felt a twinge of worry, but was comforted by the fact that I could use the long flight to
        puzzle through my concerns, and finalize my presentation before landing.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The plane took off with a bit of bumpy
        turbulence. In the seat next to me was a girl, about eleven years old. She was looking right at
        me.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“Are you scared?” she asked. “If you’re scared
        you can hold my hand.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Despite wanting to just focus on my
        presentation, I smiled at her. I noticed that she was hanging onto her mom’s hand with a death grip. I
        realized that </span><span class="calibre4">she</span><span> was the one who was scared. She was clearly
        terrified of flying. A couple more air bumps and sudden dips, and she was almost
        hyperventilating.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>So I asked, “Hey, how about I hold
      </span><span class="calibre4">your</span><span> hand?”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I started talking her through a body-scan
        practice. I probably picked it because I often used it with my own daughter right before gymnastics
        meets or dance competitions. I asked the girl to close her eyes. I asked her what was happening in her
        big toe. In her knees. In her stomach. I asked her to describe what she was feeling. </span><span
        class="calibre4">Afraid,</span><span> she said. I asked her what the fear felt like. She told me it felt
        like butterflies in her stomach, then like a tightness in her chest. She got calmer, even as she was
        more attuned to the fear she was feeling. The plane stabilized; eventually she drifted off to sleep,
        head on her mom’s shoulder.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Her mother leaned over to me with soft eyes,
        her sleeping daughter in the seat between us. She held her hand out to show me her fingers. She had deep
        nail marks from where her daughter had dug into her skin.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“I’m so thankful for your help,” she
        whispered. “It’s the first time she’s ever fallen asleep on a plane.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The body scan, as we talked about earlier,
        involves paying attention to physical sensations in the body. And while the mind may be preoccupied with
        worry or fear, doing a body scan occupies the mental whiteboard with something else—something more
        useful and productive. But it’s not about distraction or suppression. I wasn’t trying to distract this
        girl from her fear. The body scan—and so many of the other mindfulness practices we’ve worked on
        throughout this book—is about being </span><span class="calibre4">embodied</span><span> in the present
        moment. In this case, I was guiding the girl to notice the sensory experience of fear and moving her
        awareness toward those sensations. Locating it in her body, putting descriptors to it, and noticing
        these sensations would shift and change as she paid attention to them over time. It also allowed her to
        get a little distance from her fear, as she had to pay attention differently to report back to me what
        sensations were unfolding in her body as we did the practice. By the time I’d finished leading her
        through the practice, my own worries about the conference lessened, as well.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><a name="epubbookmark196"></a><span>One way to think
        about mindfulness practice, and its utility in moments like these, is that it helps us build
      </span><span class="calibre4">distress tolerance</span><span>—our capacity to manage emotional distress, to
        be steady, effective, and resilient through the toughest times, real or perceived</span><span
        class="calibre4">.</span><span> It not only strengthens our attentional and working memory capacities—it
        also builds our understanding and confidence that we can tackle what’s coming. That we can be in a hard,
        difficult moment and be okay. Mindfulness practice guides us to </span><span class="calibre4">be
        present</span><span> through stressful, upsetting, demanding circumstances, and know that we have the
        mental capacities we need to handle it.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>There’s this idea that a lot of us believe
        that resilience is something you either have or don’t have. That it has to do exclusively with how you
        grew up, or your personality, or your coping skills. What we know from the science of attention is that
        cognitive resilience </span><span class="calibre4">is</span><span> something you can train and
        build.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>After I did the body scan with the girl on the
        plane, I was able to pop my laptop open. With a clearer and less agitated mind, I could more easily
        identify where surgical revisions would strengthen my presentation. After making those strategic
        changes, I put away my computer and eased into the long journey feeling confident in the presentation I
        had prepared.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>In my work, I research how to best train
        high-performing groups as they prepare for </span><span class="calibre4">periods of high
        demand.</span><span> For a lot of these groups, we know exactly when that period will be. For soldiers,
        it’s deployment. For students, it’s exams. For athletes, it’s competition or playing season. However,
        most of us don’t know when periods of high demand may occur. What we do know is, </span><span
        class="calibre4">they will occur.</span><span> Periods of high demand are really the circumstances of
        our lives. Mindfulness training allows you not only the peak mind you need to navigate through those
        periods successfully, but also the embodied confidence that you </span><span class="calibre4">can.</span><span>
        That you can be present, focused, and capable through difficult
        circumstances. I told the girl on the plane that the turbulence would end—and so would her fear, and all
        the sensations that went along with it. It would all pass, the moment would change. She just needed to
        realize, in each moment, that she was okay </span><span class="calibre4">in that moment.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>“Do you know what the pilots do when the plane
        runs into this kind of bumpy air?” I’d asked her. She shook her head. “Nothing!” I said. “They can’t
        out-muscle turbulence, or swerve around it. They simply let it happen, and let the plane pass through.
        They hold steady until the pocket clears.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>What we gain from mindfulness—from the
        capacity to keep our attention where we need it, in the form we need it—is this fundamental
        understanding that everything passes. Everything changes. This moment will pass quickly, but your
        presence in this moment—whether you’re here or not here, reactive or nonreactive, making memories or
        not—will have ripple effects that expand out much more widely. So the question is: In this moment, can
        you be present? Can you place your flashlight on what matters to you? Let the ink fade on what doesn’t?
        Drop your expectations and see what’s right here? Avoid reactivity, judgment, and story-making and
      </span><span class="calibre4">see what is?</span><span> Can you really be here for this experience, so you
        can feel, learn, remember, and act in ways that make sense in your life, for your goals and aspirations,
        for the people around you?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>You don’t have to be born with expertise in
        these capacities—nobody is. We have to work to hone them. But now, at least, we know how.</span></p>

    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Westminster Hall is an imposing place even if
        you’re not there to present your life’s work to members of the UK Parliament as well as top military and
        emergency services leaders. Huge and turreted, some parts of it almost a thousand years old, it sits in
        the heart of London and looms over the River Thames. The room in the House of Commons where I was
        presenting, along with other experts on mindfulness training, had the hushed, weighty feel of a
        courtroom. It was long and high-ceilinged, with deep-green walls and tall, narrow windows that looked
        out onto the river. Everything was antique yet pristine—the weight of history was heavy in that room.
        Rows of benches, a deep, polished mahogany, ran the length of it. And they were all filled with some of
        the most important, influential people in the country.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I already felt rattled. I’d been preparing for
        this presentation—at that point, one of the more high-profile ones of my career—for weeks. The original
        plan had been this: Walt Piatt, who was then a major general, and I would present together. He’d have
        ten minutes, then I’d have fifteen. I’d been told to have slides prepared and to be ready to go
        immediately after him. I spent hours prepping my talk, honing it down, going over the slides. I was
        ready.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>And then, two days before the big day, Walt
        had to pull out. (When you’re a major general and something “comes up at work,” it’s not negotiable.)
        So, we pivoted—the organizers asked me to absorb Walt’s time, rework my material, and present for
        twenty-five minutes. I took a deep breath and dove back in, reworking my presentation. But it threw me.
        And arriving in London, after the long plane ride, a bit jet lagged and groggy, concerns had started to
        creep in. </span><span class="calibre4">Was my message sufficiently honed? Was my timing on track? Had I
        represented the broader view well, now that I was absorbing some of Walt’s message?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>And there was an extra, even more personal
        layer to all this for me. I would be walking into the seat of government in the country that had ruled
        over the place of my birth for nearly ninety years. I was born in the town where Gandhi organized his
        nonviolent resistance against British rule. And I’d be talking about the merits of peace-promoting
        practices to war leaders. There was poignancy to it—and a lot of pressure. As I settled myself with the
        other presenters at the front of the room, I was feeling it all: the last-minute changes, the weight of
        history, the concerns welling up about my presentation’s clarity. And then, the event organizer
        approached us. There was another twist.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The evening before our meeting, the room we
        were in had been used for a closed-door meeting about whether or not to keep Theresa May in place as the
        UK’s prime minister. This was October 2018, in the middle of the Brexit decision—tensions were high, and
        everything was up in the air. The organizers had just discovered that someone had sabotaged the
        audiovisual equipment to eliminate the possibility that the discussion regarding May could be secretly
        recorded. They had literally ripped it out of the wall. There was no way to get it back online. The
        organizers dragged in an external speaker system and scrambled around trying to find a projector, but
        three minutes before I was supposed to go on, they called it: </span><span class="calibre4">No slides.
        Wing it.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>As I readied myself to speak, I remember
        thinking, </span><span class="calibre4">everything in my life has brought me to this
        moment.</span><span> Not because if I failed, there would be dire consequences—in the grand scheme of
        things nothing terrible would happen if I tanked. It wasn’t the same as it was with some people I worked
        with: I wouldn’t get blown up by a grenade or engulfed by a fireball. I was not in jeopardy of losing an
        important case for a client or a multimillion-dollar sports contract. What I had in front of me was an
        opportunity. I had the chance to land my message with people who possessed the power to make decisions
        that radically affected other people’s lives—people who </span><span class="calibre4">were</span><span>
        put in life-and-death situations every day. I had a narrow opening to make a difference. I could either
        take it, or let it slip away.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>My thoughts seemed to settle and focus. I
        spread the printouts of the slides out in front of me, looked up at the crowd, and began to speak. I
        talked about the power of attention, how it can—and so often does—go wrong. And then I spoke about how
        it can go right: how mindfulness training can hone our focus </span><span class="calibre4">and</span><span>
        expand our awareness. How it lets us rise above the cacophony of a
        chaotic or confusing situation, take in the landscape, and in the blink of an eye make the </span><span
        class="calibre4">right</span><span> move amid so many potential wrong ones. And I talked about how the
        capacity to be present—to take in an experience without elaboration, judgment, or reactivity—allows us
        to absorb, learn, and discern so much more clearly and effectively than we would otherwise. I said that
        this kind of ability can change not only the moment you’re in, but even the trajectory of an entire
        life.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>When I was finished, I felt satisfied knowing
        I’d delivered as tight and powerful a presentation as I could have. And the last-minute changes that had
        threatened to undermine me had instead transformed into a kind of gift—with the longer time and the
        slides scrapped, I felt myself connect more fully with the audience. I had the time to expand on my
        ideas and results and to allow myself to relax into the rhythm of communicating my message with this
        esteemed audience. And instead of staring at a glowing screen as I spoke, clicking a projector remote
        from slide to slide, I’d looked out at my listeners, making eye contact, talking </span><span
        class="calibre4">to</span><span> them.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>This was what I’d been missing all those years
        ago, when I lost sensation in my teeth and realized that I was numb to so much more in my life. I’d been
        pushing hard and moving fast, my mind always churning on something; I was overwhelmed and disconnected,
        never at rest and observant. I was lost in a maze, unable to see my way out. Now, I had a tool to lean
        on. I had learned how to find my focus and own my attention. I could zoom in to direct my mind to what
        mattered, and zoom out to surveil the landscape, seeing each obstacle clearly, finding a new, better way
        around. It was like flexing a muscle I hadn’t even known was there before.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I left the grounds of Parliament practically
        floating. I’d accomplished exactly what I’d set out to do—I’d communicated as clearly and dynamically as
        I could, and maybe made a difference. I imagined the knowledge I’d shared settling in each listener like
        a seed, one that each parliamentarian, military leader, police chief, and first responder could carry
        back to their own slice of the world to take root, grow, and spread. I hoped it would help people
        navigate through stress and crisis, making the kinds of decisions—even under pressure—that aligned with
        their ethics and their goals. Maybe, like my husband, Michael, someone might achieve a better awareness
        of their own mind and find their focus so they could reach for their dreams. Or like the firefighter
        who’d sought me out thousands of miles from his home, could learn to broaden his attention to hold in
        mind the bigger picture, the larger goal, without getting fixated on small distractions and “engulfed”
        by the inevitable overwhelm of life. Or like Walt Piatt, who wrote to me while he was deployed to Iraq
        about his mindfulness practice, and told me how that daily mental training helps him hold to the
        ultimate goal—</span><span class="calibre4">peace—</span><span>even through stress and pressure, crisis
        and complexity.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>People often say, “There’s just too much
      </span><span class="calibre4">action</span><span> that needs to happen right now. How am I going to just sit
        there with my eyes closed?”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I hear this from everyone, from business
        leaders to social activists, from parents to police officers. And I get it—I felt the same way. People
        want to change the world. They want to get things done. They want to be fulfilled. To accomplish all
        this, it seems that we need to become a perpetual motion machine.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>My response to that, as someone who once also
        prioritized endless motion over ever sitting still: If you want to take action for lasting change, you
        need to have </span><span class="calibre4">all your capacity to get you there.</span><span> This is
        about claiming, and using, </span><span class="calibre4">all</span><span> your resources.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>As humans, we are facing unprecedented
        challenges with our attention systems. We live in a world that now seems built to fracture and pull at
        our attention. The innovative digital and technological tools that allow us to stay connected to each
        other, to do the work we love, to learn and progress in our lives, are the very same tools that place
        relentless demands on our attention, pulling us away from what we want or need to do.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>When we engage in mindfulness practice, we
        learn to keep our attention present in the moment for the unfolding of our lives. We step away from the
        mode where we’re simulating and planning, and we experience life directly. I said in the </span><a
        href="#epubfile5" style="text-decoration:none"><span class="calibre1">introduction</span></a><span> that
        the present moment is the only place you can use your attention. It can’t be saved up for later. It is a
        superpower—but it has to be used </span><span class="calibre4">now,</span><span> it can only be used
        now.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We used to think of attention as primarily
      </span><span class="calibre4">a tool for action</span><span>—a system for constraining information so we can
        direct our minds to do something with it. What we’re seeing now through contemplative neuroscience and
        the </span><span class="calibre4">new</span><span> science of attention is that for us to lead full and
        successful lives, attention must not only be focused for us to take action, but it must also be
        receptive so we can notice and observe. We can use it to open up to what is occurring before us. We can
        withhold judgment and story-making and see what is. We can not only frame and reframe problems, but can
      </span><span class="calibre4">de-</span><span>frame problems and see them through new eyes. And by doing so,
        our thinking, decisions, and actions will all become better aligned with what is needed in the moment,
        and what we want out of this precious life we have.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>This “new science” of attention has an
        empirical basis that is fast growing. What you are seeing in this book is the vanguard of this field—the
        push forward. We are breaking new and exciting ground on the incredible value of mindfulness and other
        contemplative practices. This is a direction we vitally need to go, and because I’ve seen the impact
        this work has had on people across a broad range of professions, people from many walks of life, I’m
        thrilled to be a part of it.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>That day in historic London, presenting to
        Parliament, I had only one regret: that I would not be able to share anything about it with my father.
        During each of the highs of my life—getting my PhD, my wedding, opening my lab, the births of my
        children—there has always been one missing piece, a shadow in the shape of him.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Earlier, when I talked about trauma and
        triggers, I mentioned how many of us have experienced them. In my life, it was a car accident that had a
        big impact on me. It changed my life, because it took my father’s. Driving back from a family road trip
        to Yosemite National Park, a drunk driver slammed into our car, veering us off a cliff and onto a field
        below. My sister and I, aged thirteen and five, in the backseat, were spared the worst of it; my mother
        on the passenger’s side, less so. My father, in the driver’s seat, was not.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>My memories from the accident are vivid but
        choppy. I remember the way the car moved just as I woke up into an unfolding nightmare. Then: the car on
        its side, the hissing of the engine, the slow realization that this was </span><span
        class="calibre4">not</span><span> merely a dream. I remember how quiet it was all around us. I could see
        a man on the cliff looking down and it struck me that he wasn’t running to help. We later surmised that
        he was likely the driver. It had been a hit-and-run—at some point after I spotted him, he must have just
        left, because nobody called for help. In the distance, I could see a small house. I knew we needed to
        get to it, call an ambulance. I picked up my sister and carried her toward it, through the field.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I was only a kid then, and I didn’t know the
        first thing about how the brain worked, or how mindfulness could transform it. This fatal accident that
        took my father’s life, and severely injured my mother, was an experience that shaped a great deal of my
        life, including my work as a neuroscientist. When I first started on this journey, embarking on my
        research into the science of attention, I didn’t know exactly what I would discover. And yet a part of
        me knew what I was searching for: that it’s not simply about being able to focus on an assignment or
        project or task. It’s not only about being more productive, or performing better at work, or being a
        more-present parent or partner. It </span><span class="calibre4">is</span><span> about those things, but
        it’s about something more, something bigger. Having a peak mind means living fully in the face of
        everything we have to deal with as human beings. Through stress and grief, through joy and
        tragedy.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I said at the beginning of this book that the
        battle for your attention is the battle for the resources to live your life. In my decades of research
        into the science of attention and mindfulness, everything I’ve uncovered along the way has only served
        to prove how true that really is. It </span><span class="calibre4">is</span><span> a battle—but it’s one
        you can win, over and over.</span></p>

    <p class="inparats" style="margin-top:18pt; margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>While a plank, bridge, or
        sit-up each targets slightly different muscles, they all improve coordination between muscle groups and
        bolster core strength. Mindfulness exercises are intended to strengthen and improve coordination between
        brain networks that carry out a variety of attentional functions: our ability to direct and maintain
        focus, notice and monitor ongoing conscious experience, and manage goals and behavior. With more
        repetition comes improved coordination between these brain networks—and greater core strength. What this
        feels like in our lives is greater mental stability and agility, which ultimately empower our
        effectiveness and fulfillment, and deepen our sense of well-being and purpose.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>This book has introduced you to three types of
        practices that work to strengthen attention. The first category of practices was about strengthening
        concentrative focus—the intention was to narrow and steady the beam of your attentional
        flashlight</span><span class="calibre4">.</span><span> These practices build your attentional control.
        Your goal was to direct your attention first to a specific target object—your breath (</span><span
        class="calibre4">Find Your Flashlight)</span><span>—and then to specific bodily sensations (</span><span
        class="calibre4">Body Scan</span><span>), and maintain it there for some period of time. When your
        attention wandered away from that object, you brought it back. Together, each of these steps comprises
        the “attentional reps” of the practice. Focus, maintain, notice, redirect. Repeat. The more reps you do,
        the more you strengthen these aspects of your attention.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The second category of practices is about
      </span><span class="calibre4">keeping watch</span><span>, as you monitor and notice the ongoing processes
        and content in your moment-to-moment experiences. Unlike the concentrative practices, here your
        attention should be receptive and broad. These were the </span><span class="calibre4">open monitoring
        practices</span><span> you tried. The challenge with these was different: There was no particular target
        for your attention; instead, you maintained a stable watch—noticing, monitoring, receptive, open. You
        took an observational stance. You allowed thoughts, emotions, and sensations to arise and then pass
        away.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>We find that when people train using open
        monitoring techniques, which are some of the more challenging exercises, they strengthen that open,
        receptive form of attention. Practice this regularly, and you will be more capable of recognizing,
        faster, that your thoughts are not facts. You’ll be able to decenter and drop the story with more ease.
        Just as your body grows stronger by doing regular physical training, this mental training will build
      </span><span class="calibre4">meta-awareness,</span><span> a heightened awareness of the rising and passing
        away of the contents and processes of consciousness, such as thinking, feeling, and perceiving.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Doing these practices consistently over time
        will change the functioning and structures of your brain. In fact, even the </span><span class="calibre4">very
        first twelve minutes</span><span> you spend will immediately change how your brain
        operates—</span><span class="calibre4">but only for those twelve minutes.</span><span> After, it will
        “default” back to its typical mode of processing. But over time, as you establish a consistent practice
        of five or more days per week, week after week, these new ways of paying attention increasingly become
        the default. While this adds up to better brain functionality, how do concentrative and receptive
        practices support us in the real world? How do they help support a </span><span class="calibre4">peak
        mind</span><span>?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>William James, the philosopher and
        psychologist who long ago pointed out that training a wandering mind would be the best kind of education
        we could offer, also observed: </span><a name="epubbookmark199"></a><span>“Like a bird’s life, [the
        stream of consciousness] seems to be made [up] of an alternation of flights and perchings.” A peak mind
        balances and values the flights and perchings, the doing and being, the directing and receiving.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>You learned a third type of practice as well,
        which emphasized connection and built on your strengthening of concentrative and receptive attention.
        But unlike the prior practices that emphasize observing the unfolding of whatever is occurring in the
        here and now, the connection practice is prescriptive: We are directing attention in a concentrative
        manner to the concept of well-wishes toward ourselves and others. During this practice, attention is
        utilized for reappraising and perspective-taking. This type of practice is designed to help us move out
        of a limited but accustomed way of paying attention and to experiment with using a different angle: we
        look at ourselves as worthy of receiving well-wishes for our happiness, safety, health, and ease. For
        example, you may be used to thinking of yourself as “too busy” for this kind of activity; you may even
        find it uncomfortable to accept these wishes. This practice is experimenting with allowing ourselves to
        receive them. We also do this for others as we progress through the practice. This is another key aspect
        of a peak mind—the capacity to be connected and caring toward ourselves and others.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Here, I’ve laid out a recommended weekly
        schedule, based on our most current data from the lab and the field, for training your attention.
      </span><a name="epubbookmark200"></a><span>The instructions are informed by current science on behavior
        change: Start with extremely small goals, achieve them, don’t miss out on the feel-good sense of success
        (this is key!), and repeat. Slowly increase the size of the goal and keep achieving it, and you’ll
        continue the rewarding feeling of accomplishing it. This is how to best support yourself in creating a
        habit—go small, feel the success of completion.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Success here does not mean that your mind
        never wandered, or that you didn’t move at all, or that you experienced bliss, peace, or relaxation.
        Rather, success means you put in the time and did the practice. Success is completion. To ensure that
        you complete the practice, tie it to some other activity that you successfully complete each day. It
        could be brushing your teeth, exercising, making yourself a cup of coffee. Researchers on the science of
        behavior change and habit creation recommend choosing an “anchor activity” for any new thing you want to
        add to your day. When you do the “anchor,” you perform the new habit you want to build. So, for example,
        your anchor could be </span><span class="calibre4">coffee:</span><span> “When I turn on the coffee maker
        to brew, I sit down and do my practice.”</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Throughout this book, I asked you to do three
        minutes per practice when I introduced you to each of the practices. As you embark on habit formation of
        daily practice, I encourage you to keep the time demands to 50 percent of what you feel is comfortable.
        Then once you are consistent, slowly expand the time. In the formal program, I recommend twelve minutes
        of daily practice. Remember: it’s not a race. Do what’s manageable. Straining doesn’t make for faster
        progress.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The schedule runs for four weeks. My hope is
        that, once you hit the end of week four, you’ll begin to experience practice-driven shifts in your daily
        life and that those results will keep you inspired to keep going. But here is the key: for mindfulness
        training to work for you, you’ve got to work it. This means a commitment to practice. Practice equals
        progress.</span></p>

    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>A reminder: in this exercise, we are
      </span><span class="calibre4">focusing</span><span> our attention on the breath, but not constraining or
        controlling it. This is not about deep breathing—a valuable activity for relaxation, but not what we’re
        doing here. Instead of controlling the breath, you are watching it as it occurs in real time, with an
        awareness of doing so. You may find your breath slows down a bit during the practice, or you have
        moments where you drift into deeper breathing. This is fine, since as we said this practice is about
        noticing your breath, not controlling it. The fact that you notice natural variations in your breathing
        patterns is a good sign. You’re on-task!</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Going beyond the formal practice, integrate
        this into your life as much as possible. Add a mindful orientation to an activity you already have to
        do. Example: mindful teeth brushing. If you’re already thinking about your to-do list as you’re
        scrubbing, bring your flashlight back. Steady it on the sensations: the cool, refreshing tingle of the
        toothpaste, the feel of the bristles, the muscles of your hand and arm moving. It takes zero extra
        minutes to layer a mindful orientation into some of your existing daily routines.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>What Week One Might Feel Like</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>A lot of people report that their mind is “too
        busy.” I hear it all the time: “It’s not working; my mind won’t sit still.” But understand this: Your
        brain is </span><span class="calibre4">not</span><span> too busy—you just have a human brain! As we
        discussed, it works like a “thought pump.” That’s exactly what it does. Your job is not to stop it—your
        job is to exist with it, and to do the work of placing your attention back where you want it.
      </span><span class="calibre4">That</span><span> is the workout.</span></p>

    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Many new practitioners go into this carrying a
        lot of “mindfulness myths” along with them. These can be destructive and demoralizing. Here are a couple
        of reminders, to debunk any damaging expectations that may be lingering from what you’ve heard about
        mindfulness in the popular discourse:</span></p>

          style="font-family:'Times New Roman'"> present in your current moment. You’re not traveling

    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>That you did it! If you did your five days, for
        twelve minutes each day, you get a gold star. It doesn’t matter how squirrely your mind felt, or if you
        opened your eyes to check the time every minute. You got yourself in the chair with the intention to
        practice, and you did it—that’s a win.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>You might have caught yourself mind-wandering
        a lot this week. Guess what? That’s great. No matter how long you were mind-wandering, the moment you
      </span><span class="calibre4">notice</span><span> it is your success point. So, if you caught yourself
        mind-wandering a hundred times in a session, that’s a lot of success. This is a big reframe, but an
        important one: what we think is a failure is actually a win.</span></p>

        in a meeting, or notice any moment in your life when you’re displaced in time and space. You’ll notice
        this happening more and more, and you’ll be able to guide your flashlight back, just as you do in

    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>The target of your attention in this week’s
        practice is body sensations. The workout is not only keeping the flashlight steady, but also moving
        it—your focus becomes something you smoothly sweep through the body. Notice that this week’s schedule is
        still asking you to continue with your basic </span><span class="calibre4">Find Your
        Flashlight</span><span> practice, every other day. What we’ve found through our work with various
        cohorts is that interleaving the practices in this way is the most effective way to build that core
        attentional strength.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span class="calibre4">Find Your
        Flashlight</span><span> is going to be a lifelong practice—you don’t “progress” past it. You keep
        expanding this practice—noticing more-nuanced changes in your moment-to-moment experience; the arising
        of an emotion, sensation, or thought; the urge to shift away; the feeling of returning back. The
        granularity will also increase the more you practice. It will strengthen your capacity to perform and
        benefit from the other practices as well; meanwhile, the other practices will inform this one. You may
        feel more moments of insight—</span><span class="calibre4">aha!</span><span> moments when you suddenly
        feel a sense of knowing, understanding, or perceiving something that had previously eluded you. This
        could be about a mental habit you have, or a challenge in a relationship, or a more fundamental
        understanding of the nature of things (for example, impermanence and interdependence).</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>What Week Two Might Feel Like</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Be aware that when you introduce the
      </span><span class="calibre4">Body Scan</span><span>, you may notice more pain and discomfort in the body.
        This can seem like a downside at first, and in fact we wondered exactly this with soldiers: Why do we
        want to make them more aware of discomfort and pain when they have to go out and experience it? But more
        knowledge of the body translates into greater capacity to act to intervene with anything you notice
        going on. (Foot pain, when attended to, could signal a soldier to notice that she needs more padding in
        her boot. This can be the difference between completing a fifty-mile hike successfully versus spraining
        her foot.) You will also notice that your story about the pain may keep the pain around for longer or
        with more intensity. You’ll be able to parse the monolithic experience of pain, separating it into
        undulating shifts of sensations—tightening, piercing, warmth, and so on. The pain will begin to be seen
        as more of a constellation, and the stories about physical sensations may quiet, as you notice the
        mind-wandering and return back to the raw data of the physical sensations.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>Frequently Experienced Challenges</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Some people find it challenging to perform the
      </span><span class="calibre4">Body Scan</span><span> on their own. If you find it difficult or distracting
        to guide yourself through it, seek out guidance, such as a recording to follow.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>And, watch out for a feeling of “chasing the
        high.” You might have had a couple really good, successful-feeling sessions last week. Don’t let
        yourself fall into this striving or chasing mode. Mindfulness practice as attention training won’t look
        (or feel) like exponential upward improvement. Often, “success” doesn’t </span><span
        class="calibre4">look</span><span> like success. A session that feels like a failure was probably a
        great workout for your brain.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>How Week Two Skills Will Show Up in Your Life</span>
    </p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Whenever anything happens—at work, at home,
        wherever you are—there’s a whole constellation of sensations that show up in the body. Stress, anxiety,
        elation, fear, sadness, excitement—they each have associated physical sensations. You’ll be noticing
        this more and more. This means that you can take action as you tap into these sensations, notice them
        quickly, and understand what they mean. For example: I know that I’ve gotten a lot better at realizing
        the sensations that begin to build when worry sets in. I feel it first in my chest, but then I check in
        with my jaw, which I usually find I’ve been clenching. With this awareness, I can intentionally relax my
        jaw and pay attention to the issue causing the worry, or at least acknowledge that I’ve gotten lost in a
        simulation, and then be able to engage with the next moment in the best way. These are
        micro-interventions that can help us course-correct as we become more attuned to our minds and
        bodies.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Integrate the </span><span class="calibre4">Body
        Scan</span><span> into your day. Remember: it takes </span><span class="calibre4">zero minutes</span><span> to
        add this into a task you might otherwise perform
        mindlessly. Do the </span><span class="calibre4">Body Scan</span><span> in the shower as you wash from
        head to toe, or as you just step in and feel the water washing over you. Don’t miss it.</span></p>

        Your Flashlight</span><span> is still your touchstone practice. But as we shift into </span><span
        class="calibre4">River of Thought</span><span>, the focus of your attention is now your own mind.
        Remember: with </span><span class="calibre4">River of Thought</span><span>, you visualize your own mind
        as a moving river. All kinds of stuff is going to float by in that moving water—your job is to observe
        it and let it go. Don’t reach down to grab any of those thoughts or worries or memories—simply notice
        them and let them float on by. Draw on the decentering and </span><span class="calibre4">Watch Your
        Whiteboard</span><span> mini-practices offered to exercise your capacity to step back and observe the
        mind. If you do find yourself wrapped up in something, go back to your breath—think of it as a boulder
        in that river that you can rest your attention on and regain your stability. Then begin observing the
        moving water again.</span></p>

    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span class="calibre4">Not engaging and not
        elaborating</span><span> are active attentional skills that require core strength to perform. You will
        build this capacity over time, but doing this for the first time in a twelve-minute formal practice can
        feel as hard as trying to hold a plank when you can’t yet do a push-up. You’ll get better at this. If
        you find yourself engaged with thoughts, worries, or memories that have floated up, remember: that
        realization is a win. </span><span class="calibre4">That’s</span><span> meta-awareness—you just did it.
        Reclaim your flashlight, redirect it to the breath to anchor yourself for a bit, and then move back into
        observing the River of Thought again.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>Frequently Experienced Challenges</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>You’ll start to become more aware of how much
        your mind is wandering. This can feel uncomfortable, or make you wonder if you’re getting worse instead
        of better. You’re not! You’re simply growing more aware. Remember: your mind has always been wandering,
        but you’re just catching yourself more. Again: success point.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>You may start noticing what’s arising in your
        mind more and more (both during formal practice and throughout the day), and it might not always be
        nice. You may find yourself realizing, </span><span class="calibre4">Man, I get angry a
        lot.</span><span> Or: </span><span class="calibre4">I’m obsessing over food (or sex or video games) and
        can’t stop.</span><span> These are not fun things to realize. Reframe it: this is information you can
        use. It’s like getting to know a new friend. You are supportive yet firm, befriending yourself, quirks
        and all.</span></p>

        Life</span></p>

        yourself, </span><span class="calibre4">What’s happening right now? What’s my mind doing? What am I
        really upset about? Why am I consumed by this?</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>You’ll notice that you start defaulting to
        taking a more observational stance toward your own thought processes; you get in the habit of checking
        with yourself to see if you have a story, and how it might be affecting your interpretation of events or
        feelings. This is an important part of what having a peak mind means, and you’re starting to get there:
        you are able take a broad, receptive, observational stance.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>You can “monitor” your mind in this way,
        outside of formal practice. Try this: While driving, walking, or riding the subway, don’t listen to
        music or a podcast; don’t take a phone call. Just sit and let your mind roam. Notice where it goes and
        what comes up.</span></p>

    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>This week’s new practice is not only about
        directing your flashlight toward other people, but also about having well-wishes for yourself, even and
        perhaps especially when you mind-wander or end up in the loop of doom. Big parts of this practice
        involve remembering that the human brain works this way by default, and then having kindness for
        yourself as you begin again.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Notice that </span><span class="calibre4">Find
        Your Flashlight</span><span> is still interleaved: this foundational practice is now reinforcing
      </span><span class="calibre4">all three</span><span> of the other practices. You draw on this key skill as
        you focus on body sensations, notice what arises in your mind, and practice directing well-wishes to
        yourself and others. </span><span class="calibre4">Find Your Flashlight</span><span> is the lifelong
        work of attention training: it reinforces all the other practices.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>What Week Four Might Feel Like</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>You might notice that spending twelve minutes
        each day making well-wishes makes you more likely to be supportive instead of punitive, curious instead
        of righteous, hoping for the best instead of expecting the worst. You may find yourself more easily able
        to “see it from someone else’s eyes” during a disagreement. This is what reappraisal and
        perspective-taking look like in our lived experience.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>Frequently Experienced Challenges</span></p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>You may find that sometimes the phrases feel
        empty, as if you’re merely reciting a word salad, or the words lose their meaning. If this happens,
        remind yourself that this is a concentrative practice. You want to use each phrase as the </span><span
        class="calibre4">complete</span><span> focus of your attention. Slow it down. Understand each word.
        Fully comprehend its meaning. And if the phrases feel too prone to elaboration and mind-wandering, try
        to just use your inner speech to say the words, one by one. The key is to comprehend and extend the
        well-wishes, without checking out or diving into the story of each.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>If you experience discomfort with directing
        phrases with well-wishes toward yourself, remember that this is part of the workout: we are
        intentionally practicing this new perspective. Notice this discomfort, but continue.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>You may also feel nothing at all—this is
        normal! And it’s still doing the work—so keep going. The effects of the workout can show up much later.
        Here’s an example: You’re saying these things for a week or two, and you feel as if there’s nothing
        really going on. Then all of a sudden you’re about to raise your voice or snap at your spouse or child
        and you catch yourself, realizing that your intention </span><span class="calibre4">is</span><span> for
        them to be happy, and there might be a better way to say this. You can shift from reacting to
        responding. You end up communicating the same message, but without the reactive tone.</span></p>
    <p class="chaphead" style="margin:24.3pt 5pt 13.5pt"><span>How Week Four Skills Will Show Up in Your Life</span>
    </p>
    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>And finally—as always—integrate this into your
        day. You don’t have to be sitting with your eyes closed to extend well-wishes toward others, or even
        toward yourself. Again, layer this into your routine. Try it as you’re walking: With the cadence of your
        steps, say silently to yourself, </span><span class="calibre4">May I be happy, may I be
        healthy.</span><span class="calibre4">&#xa0;</span><span class="calibre4">.</span><span
        class="calibre4">&#xa0;</span><span class="calibre4">.</span><span class="calibre4">&#xa0;</span><span
        class="calibre4">.</span><span> Wish it for yourself or someone you know, or extend it toward any living
        thing that you see. Have you ever been in a store or other public setting and become annoyed with a
        person you don’t know? </span><span class="calibre4">May you be happy!</span><span> No reason to waste
        time occupying your thoughts with anger. You may notice that you are more easily able to “get on the
        same page” with people as you tune in to their mental models, or that interpersonal conflicts are more
        easily resolved, or that people you previously looked past come alive to you.</span></p>

    <p class="tocfm" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>When I finish reading a good book, I’m often
        left with a longing for more words to savor. And in that afterglow, I turn to the acknowledgments page.
        Doing so always helps. In seeing the whole of the iceberg, my respect for the deliberateness taken in
        what captured me at the surface (of the page) is deepened. My experience writing this book gives me a
        different perspective. Those who allowed me to convey the words on the page are not just the rest of the
        iceberg, they are the entire ocean. Their mentoring, encouragement, collaboration, and friendship
        throughout the journey of writing this book kept me afloat. And now, I’m eager to thank all the
      </span><span class="calibre4">peak minds</span><span> that guided, inspired, challenged, and comforted me
        along the way.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>First, I wish to thank the incredible team at
        Idea Architects: Doug Abrams, Rachel Neumann, Lara Love, Ty Love, Boo Prince, and Alyssa Knickerbocker.
        I arrived with a fuzzy blueprint and a “big idea” of what I wanted to convey in a book. But they saw the
        edifice that could be created from the “building blocks” I had to offer, and they encouraged me to build
        it. Their guidance provided much-needed scaffolding, ensuring that the structure of this book was sturdy
        and strong. And in working with Alyssa Knickerbocker for writing support, I struck gold. She helped me
        sharpen my thinking to better communicate complex concepts—serving as my oxygen supply to breathe a
        lifetime of ideas, research findings, and compelling stories from compelling people into words on the
        page.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Next, I’d like to thank Gideon Weil, Judith
        Curr, Laina Adler, Aly Mostel, Dan Rovzar, Lucile Culver, Lisa Zuniga, Terri Leonard, Adrian Morgan, and
        Sam Tatum at HarperOne. Gideon first wrote to me a stunning eleven years ago, and seeded the idea that I
        might consider writing a book. He gently yet persistently tended to my germinating ideas and research
        over these years. And although it took nearly a decade, I’m so grateful that we found our way to working
        together formally in 2019. His grit coupled with his direct, insightful editorial guidance, transparent
        style, and patience have meant the world to me.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I am deeply greatly to four trusted readers
        who provided their compelling and helpful feedback on the full first draft of this book. Thank you Liz
        Buzone, Jonathan Banks, Mirabai Bush, and Mike McConville.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Thank you to my family. My husband, Michael,
        read every word of multiple drafts, serving as my in-house editor, late-night sounding board,
        motivational coach, mindfulness practice partner, and chef-chauffeur-and-concierge for the whole family
        on my many weekends and late evenings working away. Michael, this book would not have been possible
        without you. Leo and Sophie, you cheered me on throughout this process with humor, patience, and
        self-sufficiency. Your relentless curiosity, drive to learn, and the deliberateness of your choices—from
        what you eat, wear, and do to promote awareness about the climate crisis—make me want to pay attention,
      </span><span class="calibre4">better</span><span>. One member of our household I know will never read this
        book but who helped me every day is our sweet dog, Tashi. You are such a good boy.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>My father, Parag, died many decades before
        this book was conceptualized, let alone written. But his clarity and kindness have served as a guiding
        light throughout my life and throughout this book-writing journey. I am very fortunate for the loving
        support of my inspiring and spirited mother, Vandana. Thank you for reminding me to pay attention to
        myself! My sister, Toral Livingston-Jha; my brother-in-law, Simon; my nephew, Rohan; my cousin, Birju
        Pandya; and my parents in-law, Jeanne and Tony, have been much appreciated sounding boards as well as
        sources of love and support. Thank you to each of you.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>In addition to my dear family, I wish to thank
        Liz Buzone, who gently encouraged me to leave my writing cave for much-needed walks and talks. Their
        ripples are expressed in this book. I’m lucky to have such an attentive friend in you. I also want to
        thank a dear group of friends I’ve loved for nearly three decades now, known collectively as The Borg.
        Turns out, we were right all along, even from an attentional perspective—resistance is futile!</span>
    </p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I’m very fortunate that one of my close
        friends is someone with whom I have had the honor of collaborating on dozens of our large-scale research
        studies. Scott Rogers, your humor, creativity, kindness, openness, and deep knowledge and practice of
        mindfulness have made our work together not only fun but fulfilling and successful. Thank you.</span>
    </p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I wish to thank Walt and Cynthia Piatt for
        their years of collaboration and support of our research efforts. When I first met him, I was struck by
        Walt’s description of various leaders he’d met during his deployments as his friends. But I’ve since
        learned that he seeks to understand others, learn from them, and when he calls you his friend, he means
        it. I thank you both for seeking to understand attention and mindfulness, and for allowing me to
        understand what military service requires of leaders and their families. It has been a privilege to
        learn from you. I am fortunate to have each of you as my friend.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>My interest in the science of attention began
        in the laboratory of Patti Reuter-Lorenz at the University of Michigan. Thank you, Patti, for guiding me
        during those early days, and for continuing to be a trusted mentor throughout my career. Beyond what you
        taught me, it was seeing you actualize the life of a strong, successful academic leader and mom that
        helped me dream that it might be possible for me. I count my lucky stars that you accepted me into your
        lab all those years ago! And my good fortune continued in having Ron Mangun as my graduate school
        advisor at UC Davis. Ron, if it weren’t for the strong foundation you provided on the brain science of
        attention, I would have never had the confidence and courage to expand and pivot my program of research
        into unchartered waters over these years. I am deeply grateful to you both.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I also want to thank Richie Davidson. I was
        asked recently by a reporter if I would have considered studying mindfulness if Richie hadn’t said the
        word </span><span class="calibre4">meditation</span><span> at the end of a seminar at Penn nearly two
        decades ago. My answer: “No way!” Thank you for your leadership in our nascent field of contemplative
        neuroscience, and for being an activist-scientist. For their support of this field, I’d also like to
        acknowledge the Mind &amp; Life Institute. Thank you to Adam Engle and Susan Bauer-Wu for your
        leadership of this important organization, to which I am very grateful.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>For her scientific mentoring and wise counsel
        over the past decade as we’ve pursued studies in a variety of high-demand cohorts, I wish to thank Amy
        Adler, who patiently guided me over the years to take a rigorous yet flexible approach to research in
        complex real-world environments. You helped me see that we should aim to not only advance our knowledge
        of attention and the utility of mindfulness, but also to best position our research to provide
        actionable and much-needed solutions. Thank you for taking the time and interest in our research
        efforts, and providing invaluable advice. The many studies in applied settings that I reference in this
        book benefited from your guidance.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Throughout this book, I use the term “we” in
        describing the research studies conducted in my lab. This was deliberate, so that every reader is aware
        that science is a team sport. I am very fortunate to have teammates who are some of the smartest, most
        collaborative, strategic, wise, and kind people I’ve encountered. I am unable to mention every trainee
        here, but I have valued each. Ekaterina Denkova, I want to especially thank you for advising, guiding,
        and supporting all of our lab activities during those short bursts of time during the book-writing
        process when I’ve had to “disappear.” And beyond that, I thank you for your brilliant scientific
        insights, integrity, and care for the scientific process, as well as the success of our efforts. I thank
        Tony Zanesco for temporarily joining the team during the STRONG project, and returning back to our lab
        as a post-doctoral researcher. Thank you for leading many of the statistical and methodological
        innovations we’ve been able to pursue. I also want to thank past and current members of my lab,
        including Alex Morrison, Kartik Sreenivasan, Joshua Rooks, Marissa Krimsky, Joanna Witkin, Marieke Van
        Vugt, Cody Boland, Malena Price, Jordan Barry, Costanza Alessio, Bao Tran Duang, Cindy Ripoll-Martinez,
        Lindsey Slavin, Emily Brudner, Keith Chichester, Nicolas Ramos, Justin Dainer-Best, Suzanne Parker, Nina
        Rostrup, Anastasia Kiyonaga, Jason Krompinger, Melissa Ranucci, Ling Wong, Merissa Goolsarran, Matt
        Gosselin, and many other wonderful research assistants and trainees.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>When I decided to give meditation a try, I
        “randomly” happened upon Jack Kornfield’s book </span><span class="calibre4">Meditation for
        Beginners</span><span>. He was my first meditation teacher, and for that I am grateful. I’m also very
        grateful to have Sharon Salzberg and Jon Kabat-Zinn as two mentors and teachers in my life. Sharon,
        thank you for your love and friendship. Thank you also for all of your support through the book writing
        process, including reading the practice guide at the end of this book, as well as the practices provided
        throughout. I appreciate you taking the time to do so and for providing such helpful guidance. To Jon
        Kabat-Zinn, I want to say thank you for creating MBSR, and for serving as an advisor on our military
        MBAT studies. When I first told you I wanted to offer mindfulness training to military service members,
        and that I may need to do so in as few as eight hours, you were skeptical. And that respectful
        skepticism provided a very fruitful ground to have active, honest dialogue with you over all of these
        years. For that, as well as your ongoing loving interest and support of our efforts, I am very
        grateful.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>This book describes many of the research
        studies we have conducted in high demand professionals and others. I thank the funders, the participants
        in all of these studies, as well as the leadership of various organizations that partnered with us. A
        special thanks to: Gus Castellanos, John Gaddy, Stephen Gonzales, Margaret Cullen, Elana Rosenbaum,
        Jannell MacAulay, Michael Baime, Liz Stanley, Jane Carpenter Cohn, and Tom Nassif. In addition, I am
        grateful for the advisory role played by the following individuals in our work as well as in specific
        book passages: Michael Brumage, Michael Hosie, Dennis Smith, and Phillip Thomas.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>To Goldie Hawn, Marshall Ames, Maria Tussi
        Kluge, Bill Macnulty, Maurice Sipos, and Ed Cardon, I am deeply appreciative for not only your
        collaboration, but also for your invaluable support, wisdom, and friendship over the many years leading
        up to the writing of this book.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>I was very fortunate to be able to include
        in-depth interviews and narratives from Jeff Davis, Jason Spitaletta, Walt Piatt, Paul Singerman, Chris
        McAliley, Sara Flitner, Richard Gonzales, and Eric Schoomaker. Thank you for allowing me to share your
        insights and journey within these pages. You inspire me in so many ways, and I know that learning about
        each of you will inspire many others as well.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Over the course of this daunting, confounding,
        but ultimately satisfying journey, I learned that I needed to apply everything I was aiming to convey in
        this book in the writing of it. Writing this book was my own high-demand interval. Thankfully, I had
        practiced getting very quiet, slowing down, watching my mind, focusing, and broadening as needed. And I
        had other trusted tools to keep me going, day or night, on-demand, whenever I needed an extra
        boost—tools that took many forms, from practice to poetry, prose, and music. I am very grateful for
        silence, Miami rainstorms, Rumi, Pema Chodron, and Polo &amp; Pan.</span></p>
    <p class="inpara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Lastly, I thank everyone who chose to read
        this book. May it be of benefit to you.</span></p>

        Numerous studies have reported mind-wandering by sampling participants during everyday life
        (Killingsworth and Gilbert, 2010; Kane et al., 2007) as well as during experimental task performance
        (Broadway et al., 2015; Unsworth et al., 2012). Across these studies, the rates of mind-wandering range
        from 30 to 50 percent, with a high degree of variability across participants. Rates of mind-wandering
        are known to vary as a function of age (Maillet et al., 2018), time of day (Smith et al., 2018), and how
        participants are asked about it (Seli et al., 2018).</span></p>

        advantages an organism’s survival. Yet, this can lead to attention being derailed from the task-at-hand.
        Both acute and chronic stress are known to degrade attentional performance and perturb prefrontal
        cortical functioning (Arnsten, 2015). Threat increases mind-wandering (Mrazek et al., 2011) as well as
        captures attention (Koster et al., 2004). Negative mood and repetitive negative thinking decrease
        performance on tasks of attention and working memory (Smallwood et al., 2009). The costs of stress,
        threat, and poor mood in psychological disorders have been attributed to the hijacking of attentional
        resources to process such content, which drains the availability of these resources for other forms of
        information processing (Eysenck et al., 2007).</span></p>

          face/scene images. But every now and then, we’d flicker a different image on the screen: a negative
          image, something violent or upsetting</span></a><span>: In Paczynski et al. (2015), we examined the
        consequences of negative versus neutral distraction on attention, and found that the presentation of
        irrelevant negative images reduced the N170 attention effect. It is important to note that there is a
        well-established “negativity bias” wherein negative information has stronger effects (relative to
        equally extreme and arousing positive information) on a broad range of functions, such as attention,
        perception, and memory; motivation; and decision making (see Norris, 2019 for a recent review). In
        addition to negative external stimuli capturing attention, as proposed to have occurred in Paczynski et
        al. (2015), there is growing evidence that negative, more so than positive or neutral, content that is
        internally generated (i.e., negatively valanced memories and thoughts, negative mind-wandering) captures
        attention to a greater degree. And there is mounting evidence that negatively valanced mind-wandering
        impairs performance on tasks of attention and working memory (Banks et al., 2016).</span></p>

        addition to the inverted U pattern of correspondence between performance and stress described initially
        by Yerkes and Dodson (1908; also see Teigen, 1994) and many other studies since, there is recent
        evidence as reviewed by Qin et al. (2009) that the precise levels of certain stress-related
        neurotransmitters, such as norepinephrine (NE), that drive activity in brain regions such as the locus
        coeruleus (LC) show an inverted U pattern related to performance. Optimal performance is associated with
        NE levels that result in an intermediate level of LC activity. But when NE levels lead to LC
        hypoactivity and hyperactivity, performance is impaired. The point here is that it is not that stress is
        bad or good, but that the consequences are tied to the amount of stress. Distress, as opposed to
        eustress, is often shorthanded as stress. Tasks that demonstrate this stress-related inverted U pattern
        are those that require effortful engagement of attention and working memory for successful task
        performance.</span></p>

          memory</span></a><span>: Working memory is a cognitive system that allows for the short-term
        maintenance of information in a highly accessible state and the manipulation of this information in the
        service of goals. There are several prominent models of working memory. For example, whereas Baddeley’s
        model (Baddeley 2010) emphasizes the component structure of working memory, Engle’s model (Engle and
        Kane, 2004) emphasizes an individual differences approach and the role of executive control (akin to the
        central executive system of attention) in accounting for individual differences in working memory
        capacity.</span></p>

        efficient storage. Yet, there is still active debate regarding the dissociable neural systems that may

        style="text-decoration:none"><span class="calibre4">this is what I want to encourage you to do: practice
          twelve minutes a day, five days a week</span></a><span>: To determine if there is a “minimum
        effective dose” of mindfulness training, we first needed to examine if dose matters. To do so, we
        examined if there are dose-response effects, which refer to patterns in which the magnitude of a
        response varies as a function of the dose of exposure to something. In our studies, the “dose” was the
        actual amount of time that healthy participants engaged in mindfulness training exercises outside of the
        formal time they spent in a training course with a qualified trainer. The “response” was their
        performance on our evaluation metrics of attention and working memory after (versus before) the formal
        training interval. We have observed dose-response effects on cognitive task performance in many of our
        studies in high-stress cohorts. Many other research teams have reported dose-response effects in
        noncognitive domains as well (Lloyd et al., 2018; Parsons et al., 2017). The benefits of mindfulness
        training are greater in those with more (versus less) practice engagement.</span></p>
    <p class="notespara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>A key point about “dose” in studies of
        mindfulness training is that assigning participants a specific amount of practice time each day does not
        mean that they will adhere to these requirements. In fact, in our studies in high-stress cohorts, we
        have found that there is considerable variability in adherence to assigned practice. Learning this
        suggested that determining what a “minimum effective dose” is by experimentally prescribing dose
        (assigning subgroups of participants in the mindfulness training or comparison training conditions to
        different amounts of daily practice) was unlikely to be fruitful, since we would likely find variability
        in actual self-reported practice engagement in all the practice subgroups. Instead, we opted for a data
        emergent approach using the participants’ self-reports of how much they actually practiced.
        Specifically, participants were median split into high-practice and low-practice subgroups based on
        their self-reported practice. We then statistically tested to see which of these two groups
        significantly differed from each other as well as from their respective active-training comparison or
        no-training control groups, which were also part of these studies.</span></p>
    <p class="notespara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>In our initial studies (Jha et al., 2010;
        Jha et al., 2015), we assigned thirty minutes of practice every day for the entire eight-week training
        interval. Very few participants reported engaging in this dose. No significant differences were found
        when we compared the entire training group (which comprised those with low and high practice) to the
        no-training control group. But after parsing the training group into high- and low-practice subgroups,
        we found that the high-practice group’s performance was significantly better than the low-practice and
        no-training control groups. The high-practice group in this study practiced an average of twelve minutes
        daily. We used this number to guide our next step. In our next large-scale study (Rooks et al., 2017),
        we preset practice at twelve minutes a day for the duration of a four-week training interval (the guided
        practice recordings each lasted twelve minutes and participants were encouraged to complete the entire
        recording). Once again, there was variability, with some participants practicing only a few days per
        week, and some practicing more. And again, we did not find that the mindfulness training group as a
        whole significantly differed from the comparison group, which received relaxation training. We parsed
        each training group into high- and low-practice subgroups. We found that for those who received
        mindfulness training, performance was significantly better in the high-practice vs low-practice
        subgroup. The mindfulness high-practice group also performed significantly better than the relaxation
        high-practice group. The mindfulness high-practice group engaged in twelve minutes of practice, on
        average five days per week. In two follow-up studies (Zanesco et al., 2019; Jha et al., 2020), we
        constrained the practice requirements to five days a week instead of requiring them to practice every
        day throughout the entire training interval as our previous studies had required. In addition, we
        slightly increased the daily dose to fifteen minutes by providing fifteen-minute recordings (instead of
        twelve) because we were now relying on the trainers we had quickly trained instead of expert trainers.
        In both of these studies, participants largely adhered to the assigned practice, and the mindfulness
        training group as a whole performed significantly better than the no-training control group at the end
        of the training interval. These studies suggested that practicing for four to five days a week benefited
        cognitive performance.</span></p>
    <p class="notespara" style="margin-right:5pt; margin-left:5pt"><span>Thus, collectively these studies suggest
        that a minimum effective dose for benefits to attention and working memory over high-demand intervals in
        healthy participants is twelve to fifteen minutes a day, five days a week. We acknowledge that many more
        studies are required to further explore this prescription and that these results may differ for other
        metrics and other types of groups. Nonetheless, through these series of studies, we seem to have landed
        upon a recipe that many participants are willing to adhere to. In addition, it opens up many fascinating
        new lines of research regarding factors (such as personality, prior life experiences, current life
        demands, and so on) that may determine how much time people are willing to practice. For example, in our
        initial studies with Marines we found that those with openness as a personality trait and those who had
        been previously deployed were more willing to practice than others. And finally, it is critical to keep
        in mind that any research-informed prescription is based on statistics that rely on aggregate data such
        as averages, trends, and correlations. As such, it is entirely plausible that any one individual may
        experience beneficial effects of mindfulness training without conforming to this or other
        research-derived prescriptions.</span></p>
