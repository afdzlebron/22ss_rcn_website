                Building a complete Django program with all the specified features is a complex task that requires multiple files and code organization. Below, I'll provide you with a high-level overview of how to structure this project. You'll need to create the necessary Django app, models, views, templates, and implement the specific features outlined in your requirements.

                **Step 1: Set Up Django Project**
                Assuming you have Django installed, create a new Django project and a new app within it.
                
                ```bash
                django-admin startproject word_guess_game_project
                cd word_guess_game_project
                python manage.py startapp word_guess_game
                ```
                
                **Step 2: Define Models**
                In your `word_guess_game` app, define the models for the database. You can use Django's built-in models to represent Dutch words and their attributes.
                
                ```python
                # models.py
                from django.db import models
                
                class DutchWord(models.Model):
                    DUTCH_WORD_TYPES = [
                        ('noun', 'Noun'),
                        ('verb', 'Verb'),
                        ('adverb', 'Adverb'),
                    ]
                
                    dutch = models.CharField(max_length=100, unique=True)
                    word_type = models.CharField(max_length=10, choices=DUTCH_WORD_TYPES)
                    example = models.TextField()
                    translations = models.JSONField()
                    dutch_antonym = models.CharField(max_length=100, blank=True)
                
                    def __str__(self):
                        return self.dutch
                ```
                
                Don't forget to create and apply migrations for this model.
                
                **Step 3: Create Views**
                Create views for the different functionalities you want to offer: Play, Add Word, Modify, Statistics.
                
                ```python
                # views.py
                from django.shortcuts import render
                
                def play(request):
                    # Implement the Play functionality here
                    return render(request, 'play.html')
                
                def add_word(request):
                    # Implement the Add Word functionality here
                    return render(request, 'add_word.html')
                
                def modify(request):
                    # Implement the Modify functionality here
                    return render(request, 'modify.html')
                
                def statistics(request):
                    # Implement the Statistics functionality here
                    return render(request, 'statistics.html')
                ```
                
                **Step 4: Create Templates**
                Create HTML templates for each view in the `templates` directory of your app. You'll need templates for Play, Add Word, Modify, and Statistics.
                
                **Step 5: Configure URLs**
                Set up URL routing in your app's `urls.py` file to map URLs to your views.
                
                ```python
                # urls.py
                from django.urls import path
                from . import views
                
                urlpatterns = [
                    path('play/', views.play, name='play'),
                    path('add_word/', views.add_word, name='add_word'),
                    path('modify/', views.modify, name='modify'),
                    path('statistics/', views.statistics, name='statistics'),
                ]
                ```
                
                **Step 6: Implement Logic**
                Implement the logic for each of the functionalities (Play, Add Word, Modify, Statistics) within the corresponding views. This includes database operations, game logic, form handling, and statistics calculations.
                
                **Step 7: Record Game Statistics**
                For recording game statistics, you can create a separate model to store game records. Each game record should include details like game type, guessed words, mistakes, etc. You can then create a view to display these statistics and perform calculations.
                
                **Step 8: Include Database Settings**
                Make sure to configure your database settings in the project's `settings.py` file.
                
                **Step 9: Run the Development Server**
                Start the development server to test your application.
                
                ```bash
                python manage.py runserver
                ```
                
                **Step 10: Implement the Frontend**
                Design and implement the user interface using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as needed. You can use Django's templating engine to integrate dynamic data into your templates.
                
                This overview should give you a roadmap for building your Django program. However, building a complete Django application with all the specified features is a significant task and may require a detailed step-by-step implementation. You'll also need to handle database migrations, form handling, user authentication, and more depending on the complexity of your application.
